Since then the species has expanded rapidly. This wasp comes from China and is a threat to honeybees and native pollinators. It is considered an invasive alien species and must be managed under the EU invasive species Regulation. The population is managed by exterminating nests. Surveillance requires many eyes on the lookout.</p>\r\n","description":"<p>Vespawatch target beekeepers, the public and naturalists and uses them as sensors for tracking the progression of invasive Asian hornets (Vespa velutina). The data gathered by citizens are used to inform management and to perform research on the invasion of this insect. Anyone can report opportunistic observations of hornets through the web portal without registration. Data are then synced with iNaturalist and peer validated by the community. After validation, hornet nests are pushed to the management module, to which hornet managers can subscribe. Management actions are reported in the same system. All observations are openly published on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Learning outcomes include an increased awareness on invasive species and ecosystem services provided by native pollinating insects as well as a general increased appreciation for the diversity wasps and insects. More specifically, people learn to identify the different species of hornet and wasp in the region. Additionally, the project actively engages participants in citizen science activities such as ivy bvioblitzes which aim to locate hornet nests.

The citizen science project &lsquo;Looking for Cowslips&rsquo; was carried out already in 2019 and 2020 in Estonia and Latvia. Within the frames of this campaign, we obtained heterostyly data from &gt; 200 000 cowslip individuals in the first year and &gt; 155 000 in the second year. Data originating from the campaign provides unprecedented insight into the patterns of heterostyly following the loss of semi-natural grasslands.</p>\r\n","description":"<p>Participants are expected to observe the patterns of heterostyly in cowslips. The cowslip (<em>Primula veris</em>) is a heterostylous plant &ndash; it means that the plant can have one of the two types of flowers. These different type of flowers are called S-morphs (short-styled) and&nbsp;L-morphs (long-styled). In short-styled cowslips (S-morphs), five anthers are visible when looking from above, and in individuals with L-type of flowers, we can see one stigma. Normally in cowslip populations, the frequency of these different types of individuals is more or less equal. Imbalance reduces plants&rsquo; opportunities to find a suitable mate for reproduction, which impedes pollination and the exchange of genetic material. This, in turn, reduces plants&rsquo; vitality. The cowslip&rsquo;s regular habitats &ndash; traditionally managed grasslands &ndash; have become increasingly rare in the contemporary landscape. The disappearance of grasslands causes decline in plant populations depending on grassland habitats. A massive decline in cowslip populations can cause substantial imbalances in the frequency of L- and S-morphs to the extent that one of those types completely disappears from the habitat. That is precisely the kind of a possible shift in the balance between the L and S-morphs caused by changes in the landscape that we want to study &ndash; with your help. An observation takes about 30 minutes. When possible, one should observe the flowers of 100 cowslip individuals. Look at the flower and report whether you see five anthers or one stigma.

Rapidamente constituiu-se num caso de sucesso de comunicação de ciência e de promoção da saúde. O projecto holandês, entretanto alargado à Bélgica que fala flamengo, motivou investigadores do Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) a encetar uma colaboração internacional que veio dar lugar, em 2005, ao Gripenet português.\r\nAcompanhando a  actividade esperada da gripe, o Gripenet recolhe dados de Novembro a Abril. É com base nesses dados, recolhidos em questionários on-line, que é feita a monitorização da epidemia sazonal. Contudo, o site www.gripenet.pt, que serve de suporte ao projecto, está activo durante todo o ano de forma a fornecer informação sobre a doença e as temáticas com ela envolvidas. O site do Gripenet é o maior repositório de conteúdos on-line em língua portuguesa sobre a gripe.\r\nTodos podem participar na monitorização Gripenet. Basta residirem em território nacional e possuir endereço de correio electrónico. Depois de se registarem no site, os participantes recebem semanalmente uma newsletter com curiosidades e notícias sobre a gripe e são convidados a preencher, em alguns segundos, um pequeno questionário sobre os sintomas gripais (ou ausência deles) da semana anterior. A recolha de dados tem por objectivo monitorizar, em tempo real, a evolução da epidemia.\r\n\r\nDesta forma, qualquer cidadão pode contribuir com informação pertinente para o desenvolvimento de modelos epidemiológicos sobre a gripe.\r\n\r\nEsta informação não concorre com a que é obtida pelos métodos de vigilância das entidades de saúde, a cargo do Instituto Nacional de Saúde Dr. Ricardo Jorge. Tratam-se de metodologias e amostras diferentes, susceptíveis, isso sim, de se complementarem, para um melhor retrato da gripe em Portugal. Por isso, desde a primeira hora, o Gripenet tem contado com a colaboração daquele Instituto e da Direcção-Geral de Saúde.\r\nDevido às suas características, o sistema Gripenet possibilita uma detecção precoce de eventuais anomalias, e uma captação de pessoas que recuperam da gripe sem recorrer aos serviços de saúde, com uma assinalável economia de recursos. Características potencialmente úteis em caso de uma eventual pandemia.\r\nOs dados são analisados por investigadores do IGC e a informação fica disponibilizada no site sob a forma de curvas de incidência, projecção geo-referenciada em mapas de diferentes escalas, bases de dados para fins de investigação, etc. Este trabalho é acompanhado pelo desenvolvimento de modelos matemáticos e plataformas computacionais com capacidade para simular a propagação da gripe em Portugal e avaliar cenários de intervenção.\r\nO projeto Gripenet é financiado pela Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian e pelo mecenato científico. Como parceiro do projeto Epiwork , o Gripenet participa ativamente na construção de uma rede europeia de monitorização da gripe através da Internet.","keywords":[{"id":5,"keyword":"Monitoring"},{"id":105,"keyword":"Influenza"}],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":17,"topic":"Health & Medicine"}],"start_date":null,"end_date":null,"url":"http://www.gripenet.pt/","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[],"latitude":"38.765094","longitude":"-9.163992","country":"PT","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_101003030202_467_469284_358530457521197_1920111982_o.jpg","imageCredit1":"","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_101003030202_448_gripenet1.png","imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_101003030303_906_469284_358530457521197_1920111982_o.jpg","imageCredit3":"","host":"Instituto Nacional de Saúde Doutor Ricardo Jorge","howToParticipate":"Ajude-nos a monitorizar a epidemia da gripe, em tempo real.

The SEA is the base of all continental waters and regulates their speed, erosion capacity or the possibility of downwards flow.

This plant blindness can be explained by a lack of interest in and focus on plant science in education in favour of animals. However, most life on earth, including humans, depend mainly on plants for food and shelter. Consequently, it is important for society to acknowledge the importance of plants and combat plant blindness. City sidewalk plant communities survive despite the extreme stress factors of urban environments, for instance, drought, access to little soil, high levels of manual disturbance and herbicides. Therefore, these plants are highly adaptable and could show how plants change and survive in extreme environments. Previous studies in urban ecology have shown that plant species richness, and anthropogenic factors can best explain biodiversity. These factors and their role in plant species composition, richness and diversity needs further study to infer which species or species communities are highly successful in these challenging urban environments. To understand the ecology of urban plant communities could help us design sustainable and biodiverse green cities in the future.","description":"The Sidewalk Plants ((EN) / Stoepplanten (NL) citizen science project involves citizens monitoring plant species growing around their home, neighborhood or town as a whole. The goals is to find out what plant communities are most succesful, what biodiversity hotspots exist within the urban ecosystem and how their location can be explained by anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors. We believe this will generate new knowledge and understanding of plants in citizens and for science. \r\nThe project will be easy to participate in and as inclusive as possible. Participants of all ages are welcome to participate only once or many times and potentially become part of the on- and offline Stoepplanten citizen science community. During this project we want all the monitoring data to be open access and available for citizens to play with. We want to encourage citizens to come up with their own research questions and coach or enable them to work with the data to potentially answer these questions. \r\nWe also aim for citizens to become more engaged with their direct environment and observe the cities street management, research what is done and to what effect so they can be empowered to take action within their municipality. They could then write an informed petition or get politically active in any way to potentially change street management for more sustainable, biodiverse and green cities and towns.\r\nThe aim is also to increase the interest for plants and combat plant blindness. The research questions therefore include the motivation, change in attitude towards plants, knowledge about plants in the participating citizen scientists. Along the development of this citizen science project we aim to organize focus groups including scientists, citizen scientists and policy makers to constantly improve our practices.\r\nThis citizen science project is the key endeavor of a PhD project. Therefore, research output on both urban plant communities and citizen science will be published.

Researchers will be investigating this together with pupils and teachers across the whole of Sweden in the Food Waste Experiment (Svinnkollen). To assist them, they will be using an artificial intelligence (AI) app and the world&rsquo;s largest food sustainability database. Our food is responsible for over one-third of human-caused climate emissions. At the same time, almost one-third of food produced globally is thrown away. In the Food Waste Experiment, researchers will be developing and testing a new way to reduce food waste in Swedish schools: by providing more information and individual feedback. During the three weeks of the Food Waste Experiment, teachers and pupils will both help develop, and use, an app to find out how much food they are throwing away. The first week, teachers and pupils will train the AI to identify many different kinds of food. Here they will photograph their lunch plates and tell the AI what kinds of food are on the plates. The two following weeks, they will use the app to photograph their plates before and after eating, which will allow the app to calculate how much food is being wasted. Before lunch, they receive information about the day&rsquo;s menu being served in the school dining hall, the nutritional content of the various dishes and their climate footprint. The information comes from the world&rsquo;s largest database on factors relating to food and environmental impact, health and justice, developed by the company Consupedia in collaboration with researchers at Dalarna University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Through the project, researchers want to test whether it is possible to create virtuous circles in how food is dealt with &ndash; from wholesalers through to pupils. Making pupils more aware of how their food is affecting the climate, health and the environment, can lead to more thoughtful choices in the dining hall. As school kitchens get better information about what food the pupils like and dislike, menus can be adapted to better suit the needs of the pupils. The kitchens can then make more tailored orders from the wholesalers, so that the amount of waste is reduced both in school kitchens and at wholesalers.</p>\r\n","keywords":[{"id":4,"keyword":"Artificial Intelligence"},{"id":173,"keyword":"food waste"},{"id":174,"keyword":"sustainable consumption"}],"status":{"id":5,"status":"Completed"},"topic":[{"id":12,"topic":"Education"},{"id":13,"topic":"Food science"},{"id":19,"topic":"Information & Computing sciences"}],"start_date":"2020-11-09","end_date":"2020-11-27","url":"https://forskarfredag.se/forskarfredags-massexperiment/svinnkollen/","mainOrganisation":{"id":6,"dateCreated":"2020-09-08T06:48:03.452860Z","dateUpdated":"2020-09-08T06:48:03.452892Z","name":"Vetenskap & Allmänhet (VA – Public & Science)","url":"https://v-a.se/english-portal/","description":"VA (Public & Science) is a Swedish non-profit membership organisation that works to promote dialogue and openness between researchers and the public.\r\n\r\nVA’s members consist of some 90 organisations, authorities, universities, companies and associations.

Environmental monitoring systems, such as Copernicus Corine Land Cover, produce a variety of valuable datasets, offered for the entire EU landscape. Yet, the update rate is scarce due to increased costs and timely data validation procedures, while investing in additional in-situ equipment or in maintaining the current infrastructure is unsustainable. Citizen science constitutes an innovative approach of environmental monitoring, capable to complement the existing Earth Observation and in-situ infrastructure with up-to-date information about local ecosystems.  The majority of citizens however, both as individuals and as groups quite often feel disengaged from influencing environmental policies, whilst also remain unaware of publicly available information and initiatives. \r\nSCENT Citizen Observatory project has created a toolbox (https://scent-project.eu/scent-toolbox) of smart collaborative technologies and applications that aims to engage citizens with environmental monitoring, enabling them to become the ‘eyes’ of the policy makers and local authorities. Citizens are using low-cost equipment to collect various environmental information (land cover/use, river parameters, soil conditions), that are consolidated to improve flood modelling and are offered to the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) in an interoperable way, following common environmental standards (Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards). ","description":"The project designed, developed and implemented a people-centric observation web, formulated on the basis of using low-cost, portable sensors and innovative applications.  The SCENT toolbox offers various capabilities involving crowdsourcing and serious gaming mechanisms towards enabling, incentivising and increasing the involvement of citizens as individuals and/or citizen groups/associations in the process of environmental monitoring. By using their smartphones and portable sensors, citizens can take images of land cover / land use while walking around in their city or the countryside, report events that may affect floods (e.g. river obstacles) and measure water level, flow velocity and soil moisture, without complex or bulky equipment. They are doing this in a playful manner, through a game of ‘catching’ animated animals in their surroundings and collecting points. \r\nOn top of that, novel frameworks are employed to ensure the management, quality control and interoperability of citizen-generated data, coupled with machine learning frameworks that extract valuable information from the collected resources and thus lead to better use of available data, repositories and in-situ monitoring systems. Last but not least, apart from extending the in-situ infrastructure with citizen-sourced observations, the use of the latter was demonstrated in the context of creating flood models and land cove / use maps of enhanced characteristics that can improve decision making.  \r\nAdditionally, the value of the SCENT toolbox was demonstrated in two regions in real but diverse examples where flood monitoring is of great importance. The first region is the wetland of Danube Delta in Romania, where flooding is a necessary and beneficial part of maintaining the ecosystem, and the second is the Kifisos River basin around the urban landscape of Athens in Greece, where flooding is a major problem for the local communities.\r\nVarious citizen-science campaigns (10 in total) were conducted during 2018 & 2019 in these regions. These field campaigns were organised in different periods in both pilots covering in total 11 months, while focusing on themes of interest to the local communities and the policy makers such as the collection of LC/LU elements, river parameters and soil measurements. The objective of the campaigns was to collect valuable environmental information, at frequent time intervals, that could be further analysed and used. \r\nMore than 700 volunteers participated in the field campaigns, testing, evaluating and validating the SCENT toolbox, while also contributing with a significant amount of 24200+ environmental resources in both pilot areas. It should be noted, that SCENT has at the same time established an active online community, involving, as of August 2019, 1130+ active registered users of its public facing applications (SCENT Explore, SCENT Collaborate, SCENT Measure, https://scent-project.eu/scent-toolbox).

(Mediterranean Elasmobranchs Citizen Observations) project.","description":"Sharks and rays have been present on earth for nearly half a billion years, with more than 1,250 extant species. The pivotal importance of cartilaginous fish for marine ecosystems is highlighted by the fact that most shark and some ray species constitute top predators, thus possess central and stabilizing functions in marine food webs. Based on the latest report of IUCN at least half of the rays (50%, 16 of 32 species) in the Mediterranean Sea face an elevated risk of extinction, as well as 54% of sharks (22 of 41). The principal driver for this is overfishing along with the life history characteristics of these species (low reproductive, slow growth rates and long life spans). In Greek Seas at least 67 species of cartilaginous fish are present but existing knowledge on their distribution, ecology and biology is still limited. In Cyprus, studies related to the presence/biology of cartilaginous fish are limited and deficient. Around 30 species of cartilaginous fish have been reported to be present in Cypriot waters to date. \r\n\r\nM.E.C.O. (Mediterranean Elasmobranchs Citizen Observations) is a Mediterranean initiative which aims to create a network of Mediterranean elasmobranch sightings data, through a collaboration between different teams in various countries, to better understand the occurrence, seasonality and distribution of elasmobranchs in this region. The project \"Sharks and Rays in Greece and Cyprus\" is part of M.E.C.O. and it aims at recording observations of sharks and rays from Greece and Cyprus through the help of sea user citizen scientists. The data will be used to study the distribution and biology of these species. \r\n","keywords":[{"id":3,"keyword":"Biodiversity"},{"id":5,"keyword":"Monitoring"},{"id":12,"keyword":"Sea"},{"id":13,"keyword":"Marine"},{"id":14,"keyword":"Ocean"},{"id":23,"keyword":"Nature"},{"id":24,"keyword":"Wildlife"},{"id":26,"keyword":"Coastal"},{"id":44,"keyword":"Conservation"}],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":2,"topic":"Animals"},{"id":5,"topic":"Biodiversity"},{"id":7,"topic":"Biology"},{"id":11,"topic":"Ecology & Environment"},{"id":22,"topic":"Ocean, Water, Marine & Terrestrial"},{"id":23,"topic":"Nature & outdoors"},{"id":26,"topic":"Science policy"}],"start_date":"2017-06-07","end_date":null,"url":"https://isea.com.gr/activities/programs/fisheries/sharks-and-rays-in-greece-and-cyprus/?lang=en","mainOrganisation":{"id":64,"dateCreated":"2020-11-16T11:06:38.817834Z","dateUpdated":"2020-11-16T11:06:38.817861Z","name":"iSea, Environmental Organisation for the Preservation of the Aquatic Ecosystems","url":"https://isea.com.gr/","description":"iSea is a Not-for-Profit, Non-Governmental Organisation founded in 2016 in Thessaloniki, Greece.

With increased attention to citizen science, CSA brings depth to how citizen science is understood both as public engagement and as research, and shines a light on the integrity and complexity of the practice. \r\nOUR CORE SERVICES - Biennial conference; Peer-reviewed & Open Source journal: Citizen Science: Theory and Practice; Skills-based webinars; Field-building Working Groups; Monthly newsletters; Discussion Listserv. \r\nWHO WE SERVE - We connect over 6,000 people who design, lead, manage, and study citizen science to exchange knowledge, identify shared concerns, and advance innovative work. Multidisciplinary and multidimensional by nature, citizen science depends on connections to foster synergies, highlight practices that strengthen these efforts, and accelerate the pace of improvement. \r\nWe partner with sister organizations on other continents to engage a global conversation, but focus our convening and communication efforts towards a North American audience. We work to build strategic alliances with other societies (of disciplines and practices) to keep expectations for citizen science appropriately high.\r\nAssociation members directly support our work to advance the field of citizen science. Members build their professional network and shape the future of the field by contributing to working groups and by voting on key decisions about direction, priorities, and leadership for the association. \r\nA number of organizations and institutions support the Citizen Science Association through annual memberships. Each of these members also has the opportunity to offer an educational webinar annually.\r\nMembers and non-members alike can sign up to receive updates through a monthly newsletter, and are welcome to join a discussion listserv for sharing questions, ideas, innovations, and announcements among peers in this field.","logo":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-11-16_090911115050_91_CSA-logo-stylized-square_whitebackground2.png","contactPoint":"Citizen Science Association","contactPointEmail":"info@citisenscience.org","latitude":"39.783730","longitude":"-100.445882","country":"US","creator":2303,"orgType":2},"organisation":[],"latitude":"39.783730","longitude":"-100.445882","country":"US","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-11-17_111111110909_598_ppsr.png","imageCredit1":"","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-11-17_111111110909_261_logoCSA.png","imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-11-17_111111110909_998_ppsr.png","imageCredit3":"","host":null,"howToParticipate":"In order to participate, please contact the co-chairs of the Working Group at data_cochair@citizenscience.org.","doingAtHome":false,"equipment":"","fundingBody":null,"fundingProgram":"","originDatabase":null,"originURL":"","originUID":"","featured":false,"customField":[],"dateCreated":"2021-02-23T10:16:07.491698Z","origin":null},{"id":227,"name":"RiuNet","aim":"<p>RiuNet is a citizen science project that aims to bring citizens closer to rivers and involve them in the evaluation of their hydrological and ecological status.

One characteristic that makes birds so fascinating is their spectacular colouration. From the striking iridescence of hummingbirds to the vibrant colours of macaws, birds have evolved an astounding diversity of colours and patterns.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the colours that we can see, many bird species can also perceive light in the ultraviolet (UV) range of the spectrum. The discovery that many birds see and respond to UV colouration has had a significant impact on how researchers now measure bird plumage colouration, as well as on our understanding of how birds see each other.\r\n\r\nOur team is hoping to measure the dazzling array of plumage colouration in birds to gain a better understanding of how and why spectacular animal colouration evolves. Some of the key questions we hope to answer are:\r\n\r\nJust how colourful are birds?\r\nHow quickly does plumage colour evolve?\r\nAre evolutionary changes in plumage colour associated with the origin of new species?","description":"1. Selecting specimens\r\nSpecimens are selected from the bird collections at the Natural History Museum, London. Where possible, three males and three females are chosen for each species. Our aim is to photograph as many bird species as possible.\r\n\r\n2. Photographs: human-visible and UV light\r\nWe photograph each specimen with a specialist camera that can capture human-visible (400–700 nm) and ultraviolet (UV, 300–400 nm) wavelengths of light. We take photos in pairs, first with a filter that only transmits human-visible wavelength and second with a filter that only transmits UV wavelengths. We take six photographs of each specimen:\r\n\r\na. Back view — visible + UV\r\nb. Side view — visible + UV\r\nc. Belly view — visible + UV\r\n\r\n3. Zooniverse!\r\nTo make sense of the colour information stored in the photographs, we need to identify different areas of the bird's plumage, such as the crown, breast and tail. Colour in these different \"patches\" can serve different functions in different species, often including signalling (e.g. attracting mates, warning predators). We need your help to mark each of 10 different patches on the photographs.\r\n\r\nThere are two main workflow types: points and outline.\r\n\r\n– Points - place points to locate 10 key bird body regions.\r\n– Outline - trace the outline by drawing a polygon​ around the edge of the bird\r\n\r\nEach workflow can be performed on three different views of the bird (back, side, belly).\r\n\r\n4. Data & Discoveries\r\nThe points you place provide us with {X,Y} coordinates telling us where to measure within each image. Based on this information, we then extract data on colouration and pattern for each specimen, which we use to tackle important unanswered questions on the causes of evolution of colouration and the role that colour differences play in the origin of species.\r\n\r\n5. Outcomes\r\nThe database that you can help to build starts from museum collections. Our aim is to pass the data back to the NHM via the Data Portal. This means that you will be contributing not only to research on bird evolution but also helping to build a digital legacy of museum collections.\r\n\r\nHow can you help?\r\nWe need your help to identify key areas of bird plumages to generate the raw data we need to tackle big, unanswered questions about evolution. Along the way, you will:\r\n\r\n1. See a dazzling array of plumages from many thousands of species – some of which are now vanishingly rare\r\n2. Explore hidden dimensions of plumage colouration by studying both human-visible and UV images of birds\r\n3. Directly contribute to the most ambitious study of animal colouration ever undertaken\r\n4.

The greylag goose is long-term socially monogamous whereas the endangered northern bald ibis is seasonal monogamous. Both avian model species are free-flying and habituated to the close presence of humans. The birds of the KLF are individually marked with leg rings and the social behaviour of the flock of greylag geese and the colony of northern bald ibis has been monitored over decades.

The participation of citizen scientists in several steps of the scientific process &ndash; from project design, data acquisition to scientific publication &ndash; is the main focus of the Nightingale Research Project.

Thousands of nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos) arrive in Berlin and in gardens, parks, along railway lines and even on busy street corners. From Grunewald to Pankow, these songsters&rsquo; melodic whistling and gurgling song can be heard, elating the attentive Berlin listeners. Songs, poems, pictures and stories show the fascination and love that people have for the nightingales. But how much do scientists actually know about these little migrant birds?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citizen Science</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A group of scientists at the Museum of Natural History Berlin (MfN) are calling on the help of the public to become citizen scientists and record the nightingales&rsquo; songs with their smart phones using the Naturblick app (developed by the MfN). These snippets of song are then downloaded onto the Nightingale website map (Berlin 2018, Germany wide 2019) for all to hear and analyse. The recordings and other information collected by the citizen scientists are used to reveal understanding on the private lives of these little songsters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Culture</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is probably no other bird that has received as much attention in literature and music as the nightingale. Certainly, this is due to its complex, often beautifully versatile singing. What does the nightingale mean to you? Have you yourself listened to its song, does it have a special place in your life? These are some of the questions we asked our citizen and received exciting answers and stories, which we have collected in our anecdotes book. In addition, we organize various events, which take place throughout the year to engage with the citizen scientists and explore the cultural perspective of the nightingale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citizen Science at School</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Urbanisation is progressing uninterrupted worldwide. This increases the responsibility of cities for the preservation of biodiversity both outside and inside city boundaries. This is particularly true for Berlin, Germany&#39;s largest metropolis and the city with the richest diversity. A key objective of urban nature conservation is to bring the city&#39;s nature closer to its inhabitants. Children and young people in particular should be encouraged to do so by making the city&#39;s nature tangible and drawing attention to the preservation of green oases for more urban diversity in flora and fauna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One aim of the environmental education of the project is to give students the opportunity to experience Berlin&#39;s urban nature and its scientific recording using the nightingale as an example. The nightingale is particularly suitable for this purpose, as its powerful-voiced males make it easy for beginners to determine the bird&#39;s voice. In this context, we investigated the effectiveness of Citizen Science on the interest of students in nature and environmental protection.</p>\r\n","keywords":[{"id":30,"keyword":"Birds"},{"id":35,"keyword":"urban nature"},{"id":36,"keyword":"bird song"}],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":8,"topic":"Birds"}],"start_date":"2018-01-01","end_date":"2020-06-30","url":"https://forschungsfallnachtigall.de","mainOrganisation":{"id":73,"dateCreated":"2021-02-24T17:23:21.652503Z","dateUpdated":"2021-02-24T17:23:21.652516Z","name":"Museum für Naturkunde Berlin","url":"https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en","description":"The Museum für Naturkunde Berlin  – Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science – is an integrated research museum within the Leibniz Association.

Take spider pictures and investigate spider colour and webs to discover if spiders adapt to living in the city.","description":"Have you ever walked around the city in the summer? Then you know it can get very hot because of all the asphalt and the concrete that retains the heat! Staying cool in this heat is not only a problem for humans, but also for animals. But this is just one of the challenges they face. The city is a completely new environment that they must be able to adapt to. Cities can therefore be seen as \"living laboratories\" where evolution takes place in real time! In the SPIDER-CITY project we want to investigate how spiders can adapt to city life.\r\n\r\nWe focus on two important spider traits: colour and webs. \r\nSpider colour. Much like a white car heats up less in the sun compared to a black car, so does a lighter spider heat up less compared to a dark spider. Therefore we expect city spiders to evolve a more lighter colour as this protects them from overheating in an already hot city. \r\nSpider webs. As the main tool for prey capture, webs are crucial for spider survival. Due to a lower supply of prey in cities, we expect to see webs with a smaller mesh size that are more efficient in capturing prey.\r\n\r\nHow?  \r\nCitizen scientists are a crucial part of the SPIN-CITY project! Using the SPIDERSPOTTER app you can take spider photos and report specific observations. You can analyze your own photos and those of others on the SPINNENSPOTTER website to determine spider color, length and web size. An interactive map ensures that our results are accessible to everyone who is interested!\r\n\r\nWhy study adaptations to city living in spiders?\r\nNot only do we get crucial information about how animals can adapt to climate change, studying spiders can also be very useful for us humans! We can use spider color as a natural thermometer and thus better determine how quickly our environment heats up. And who knows, by examining in detail how a spider uses color to stay cool, we might even find new ways of staying cool in the city ourselves!\r\n\r\nRead more about SPIDERSPOTTER and the SPIDER-CITY project on www.spiderspotter.com!\r\n","keywords":[],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":2,"topic":"Animals"},{"id":7,"topic":"Biology"},{"id":23,"topic":"Nature & outdoors"}],"start_date":"2019-09-11","end_date":null,"url":"www.spiderspotter.com","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[],"latitude":"51.035392","longitude":"3.722528","country":"BE","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-21_090904045656_818_Promo_01_1280x800.jpg","imageCredit1":"","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-21_090904045656_154_SPS_Logo_SocialMedia_Avatar_980px.png","imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-21_090904045858_991_Citizen_Science_Expo-49.jpg","imageCredit3":"An Van Gijsegem","host":"UGent","howToParticipate":"","doingAtHome":true,"equipment":"smartphone, laptop","fundingBody":null,"fundingProgram":"","originDatabase":null,"originURL":"","originUID":"","featured":false,"customField":[],"dateCreated":"2020-04-21T09:53:53.285243Z","origin":""},{"id":118,"name":"Mysnowmaps","aim":"The goal of the CSEOL poject is to enlarge the Mysnowmaps Community and engage the users in sharing data.

After the introduction of the observation, it is inserted in the internal database of the platform for species validation (if it is not possible to validate at the species level, the validation is carried out to the lowest possible taxonomic level).

Involvement of citizens created the capacity to spread the issue and the data utcoming from the citizens science campaigns that have gone by since 2017 in many Italian cities, not only as a result of the organization of Citizens for Air, but also, as a result of the effort by Citizens for air to share the model of the project and bases to replicate it, in many more communities and cities which were eager to organize it by themselves.

Over time, particles that are present in the air accumulate in their leaves. By applying biomagnetic techniques we can identify which compounds are in the leaves and therefore in the air. And by doing an aggregate study we know the concentration of pollutants in the air of Spain.\r\n\r\nPrevious studies have already shown that the concentration of pollutants correlates strongly with the volume of traffic and with other agents such as trains or trams. Vigilantes del Aire is a project that replicates in Spain the Airbezen project of the University of Antwerp, the result of the collaboration between Professor Samson Roeland and the Ibercivis Foundation.\r\n\r\nTraffic-related emissions are emissions from exhaust and from wear or corrosion of the brakes and engine. With Vigilantes del Aire we want to apply the concept of biomonitoring and citizen science. In some cities in Spain air quality is already measured in stations, but we want to do it hand in hand with citizens to involve them first hand in the research process and raise awareness for environmental care.\r\n\r\nAdvanced technologies are usually used in electronic devices and automatic sensors, or even apps on smartphones. In Vigilantes del Aire we want to propose a more open and humane alternative, relying on traditional processes such as watering a plant, pruning it, or sending a letter by post. In the center, we put plants as living beings that we can all take care of and maintain.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental research: \r\n\r\nThe leaves given to us by citizens will be analyzed in the laboratory by a magnetization method that will allow us to obtain the amount of magnetizable particles that have been deposited on the leaves. The magnetizable particles come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, from the wear and tear of brake discs and other elements such as the wheels on the rails of trains and trams.\r\n\r\nOnce the pollutants in each sample have been identified, the concentration will be analysed at a local level in the different cities selected, and an aggregated study will be carried out at a national level. With these data, different maps will also be made, which will be uploaded to this website.\r\n\r\nAll participants will be notified of the results of their samples and the scientific results will be openly shared.","keywords":[{"id":48,"keyword":"biosensors"},{"id":49,"keyword":"air quality"},{"id":50,"keyword":"sample collection"}],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":11,"topic":"Ecology & Environment"}],"start_date":"2019-05-01","end_date":"2020-06-30","url":"https://vigilantesdelaire.ibercivis.es/","mainOrganisation":{"id":2,"dateCreated":"2021-03-12T16:14:44.312362Z","dateUpdated":"2021-03-12T16:14:44.312375Z","name":"Ibercivis Foundation","url":"ibercivis.es","description":"\r\nIBERCIVIS is the national private non-for-profit foundation devoted to citizen science in Spain.

IBERCIVIS was legally established in 2012 but the consortium has been working closely since 2007 both in Spain and Portugal (see www.ibercivis.pt). Since then, we have deployed more than 60 experiments from 40 different research groups reaching over 60.000 citizen scientists. Ours set of experiments and include volunteer computing (e.g. simulation of nuclear fusion devices yielding on average 8 million hours and 2.3 TFLOPS), volunteer sensing (e.g. odour nuisances reports: OdourCollect), participatory experiments (e.g. human behaviour in dilemma), or collective intelligence projects (e.g. collective music composition) among others. We support groups with hardware (e.g. hosting, load balance, security services), middleware (e.g. tech eulogies such as BOINC, PyBossa, EpiCollect) and software development (e.g. multi device developments or libraries such as gromacs or autodock). Despite ICT and virtual experiments are our focus, due to the digitally enabled borderless transformation of research, reaching new scales of number and range of contributors, we also work offline with expanded laboratories open to the public such as fablabs or wet labs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe deploy, support and promote the general public engagement in science with research and educational purposes. We play a central role in the Citizen Science Community at local, national and international levels. We are the national institution of Spain promoting citizen science and we run the portal Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain (www.ciencia-ciudadana.es) We are part of the steering committee of the European Citizen Science Association, linking it with responsible research and innovation, working on the adaptation of the RRI-Tools self reflection tool for the CitSci communities and #CitSciChatES among other actives. Since 2012 we coordinate the European project Socientize (www.socientize.eu) which delivered the White Paper on Citizen Science for Europe, referenced as a flagship document for the citizen science policy making. IBERCIVIS and Socientize have been referenced as best practices by several institutions and initiatives, highlighting the European Commission, the Australian Citizen Science Association, RRI-Tools, RRI-ICT, Ars Electronica or Cotec Foundation among others. IBERCIVIS has been marked as good practice in several scenarios, including open governance and grass-roots initiatives. We set up the interaction between science and society for scientific policy making in Socientize. In addition to create the inclusive scenarios for citizen-lead projects, we support social innovation by providing scientific resources and equipment for citizen involvement in scientific research.\r\n\r\n\r\n","logo":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-07_101009094141_643_LOGO_DEF_1.png","contactPoint":"Francisco Sanz","contactPointEmail":"info@ibercivis.es","latitude":"41.684275","longitude":"-0.887436","country":"ES","creator":1,"orgType":2},"organisation":[],"latitude":"41.684547","longitude":"-0.887328","country":"ES","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_020203035858_899_vigilantes_despierta_aragon-1000x675.jpg","imageCredit1":"","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_020203035858_661_logo_vigilantes_aire-1.png","imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_020203035959_98_vigilantes_despierta_aragon-1000x675.jpg","imageCredit3":"","host":"Ibercivis Foundation","howToParticipate":"Citizens only have to go to one of the collection points indicated (announced by social networks, press, radio, TV), and can take home a measuring station, in this case a strawberry plant.\r\n\r\nBy taking responsibility for looking after one of the measuring stations, the citizen is making a commitment to science.

In this project we investigate, which animals are killed on roads and which factors are influencing roadkills. Your data allows us to identify roadkill hotspots. Our vision is to mitigate those hotspots in cooperation with local authorities.\r\nWhat does roadkill mean?\r\n\r\nRoadkills are all animals killed on roads. In most countries, official data on roadkills are only available for huntable wildlife. In the year 2012, amongst others 24852 European hare, 36865 Roe deer, 1414 European badgers were killed on roads in Austria. However, there are no data available on the effects of roads on non-huntable wildlife or red list species such as European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) or European green toad (Bufo viridis).\r\nWhy is roadkill important?\r\n\r\nHabitat fragmentation by roads has a severe impact on many animal species, particularly for those with high mobility or seasonal migration behaviour, such as mammals or amphibians. As a consequence, roadkill is one of the main reasons for the decrease of populations of several animal groups. Compared to a human flat, habitat fragmentation is like a road right in your corridor, seperating your living room from your kitchen.\r\n\r\nAnimals cross roads when foraging, in mating season (like deer, which cover long distances in search for a mating partner in autumn) or changing from winter to summer habitat (like amphibians). Species which migrate over long distances are especially affected by roadkill.\r\n\r\nHumans are also affected by roadkill. For drivers animals on roads are a great danger and most people are stressed because of the ethical burden when killing an animal. Not only accidents with big animals like deer or wild boar are causing damages to persons and/or property, also small animals like hedgehogs or toads can lead to damage because of evasion or breaking maneuvers.","keywords":[{"id":92,"keyword":"road ecology"},{"id":93,"keyword":"animal-vehicle-collision"},{"id":94,"keyword":"vertebrates"}],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":2,"topic":"Animals"},{"id":5,"topic":"Biodiversity"},{"id":6,"topic":"Biogeography"},{"id":29,"topic":"Transportation"}],"start_date":"2014-01-01","end_date":null,"url":"https://roadkill.at/en/","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[],"latitude":"48.236509","longitude":"16.337142","country":"AT","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_090903033030_792_2fa67f482133f1c934235b73c2a03954_L.jpg","imageCredit1":"(c) by Klaus Schindler; bearbeitet von Philipp Hummer (SPOTTERON)","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_090903033030_536_Logo2019_Roadkill_SPOTTERON.png","imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_090903033030_83_2fa67f482133f1c934235b73c2a03954_L.jpg","imageCredit3":"(c) by Klaus Schindler; bearbeitet von Philipp Hummer (SPOTTERON)","host":"University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna","howToParticipate":"The participation in the project Roadkill is designed in such a way that both the first steps in the project and the participation are as easy as possible.

IBERCIVIS board is formed by the Ministry of Innovation and Competitiveness of Spain, the regional Government of Aragon, CSIC, CIEMAT, University of Zaragoza and the Zaragoza City of Knowledge Foundation. IBERCIVIS was legally established in 2012 but the consortium has been working closely since 2007 both in Spain and Portugal (see www.ibercivis.pt). Since then, we have deployed more than 60 experiments from 40 different research groups reaching over 60.000 citizen scientists. Ours set of experiments and include volunteer computing (e.g. simulation of nuclear fusion devices yielding on average 8 million hours and 2.3 TFLOPS), volunteer sensing (e.g. odour nuisances reports: OdourCollect), participatory experiments (e.g. human behaviour in dilemma), or collective intelligence projects (e.g. collective music composition) among others. We support groups with hardware (e.g. hosting, load balance, security services), middleware (e.g. tech eulogies such as BOINC, PyBossa, EpiCollect) and software development (e.g. multi device developments or libraries such as gromacs or autodock). Despite ICT and virtual experiments are our focus, due to the digitally enabled borderless transformation of research, reaching new scales of number and range of contributors, we also work offline with expanded laboratories open to the public such as fablabs or wet labs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe deploy, support and promote the general public engagement in science with research and educational purposes. We play a central role in the Citizen Science Community at local, national and international levels. We are the national institution of Spain promoting citizen science and we run the portal Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain (www.ciencia-ciudadana.es) We are part of the steering committee of the European Citizen Science Association, linking it with responsible research and innovation, working on the adaptation of the RRI-Tools self reflection tool for the CitSci communities and #CitSciChatES among other actives. Since 2012 we coordinate the European project Socientize (www.socientize.eu) which delivered the White Paper on Citizen Science for Europe, referenced as a flagship document for the citizen science policy making. IBERCIVIS and Socientize have been referenced as best practices by several institutions and initiatives, highlighting the European Commission, the Australian Citizen Science Association, RRI-Tools, RRI-ICT, Ars Electronica or Cotec Foundation among others. IBERCIVIS has been marked as good practice in several scenarios, including open governance and grass-roots initiatives. We set up the interaction between science and society for scientific policy making in Socientize. In addition to create the inclusive scenarios for citizen-lead projects, we support social innovation by providing scientific resources and equipment for citizen involvement in scientific research.\r\n\r\n\r\n","logo":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-07_101009094141_643_LOGO_DEF_1.png","contactPoint":"Francisco Sanz","contactPointEmail":"info@ibercivis.es","latitude":"41.684275","longitude":"-0.887436","country":"ES","creator":1,"orgType":2},"organisation":[],"latitude":"41.653684","longitude":"-0.885137","country":"ES","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_050503035757_560_xmite-67638_1280-e1523888468182-600x450.jpg.pagespeed.ic.oxOZqRaDFc.jpg","imageCredit1":"","image2":null,"imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_050503035757_840_xmite-67638_1280-e1523888468182-600x450.jpg.pagespeed.ic.oxOZqRaDFc.jpg","imageCredit3":"","host":"Unizar","howToParticipate":"Go to the homepage","doingAtHome":true,"equipment":"","fundingBody":{"id":7,"body":"FECYT"},"fundingProgram":"","originDatabase":null,"originURL":"","originUID":"","featured":false,"customField":[],"dateCreated":"2020-09-09T00:09:37.120022Z","origin":""},{"id":95,"name":"Atlas of Estonian mammals","aim":"During the project, Estonian Environmental Agency will collect all available data on mammals and produce a systematic review of distribution.

Asteroid Hunters (known Cazasteroides in Spanish) puts at the disposal of the citizenship a tool to collaborate in the protection of the Earth against the impact of asteroids.","description":"Currently there is a population of 750,000 asteroids and each month about 2000 new objects are discovered. About 2% of the total number of asteroids are classified as NEAs (Near-Earth Objects) and about 10% -2000 are PHAs or potentially dangerous asteroids for the Earth, that is, asteroids with a non-zero probability of impact against our planet. The Minor Planet Center of the International Astronomical Union is the body that records the asteroid database, maintained with the observations of professional astronomers and amateurs.\r\n\r\nResearchers at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) have developed an app that allows anyone, and in a friendly way, to help control the population of asteroids. It is a free application for mobile devices called “cazasteroides”. Being a asteroid hunter is simple, it only requires having the app installed (in its Android version, iOS or in a web browser) and visual acuity. The user sees in their mobile a sequence of images of the sky and marks those objects suspected of being asteroids – they move on the fixed background of stars. The detections are first filtered by the users themselves – through a voting system – and finally it will be a team of professional astronomers that verify the true nature of the objects detected.\r\n\r\nThe application includes gamification techniques to make it more attractive to users, rewarding them with points for their actions. The project of Asteroid Hunters already has a large community of users and other large figures: the more than 6,420 users have added a total of 209,000 detections, 1,25 M votes cast, 3,700 known objects and 760 candidates, that is, there is a total of 760 objects that the MPC does not have cataloged and that for now have been approved as possible new asteroids.\r\n\r\nThe final goal in the medium term is to have a worldwide network of telescopes that contribute their images and are part of this application so that, in a very fast and thanks to the collaboration of thousands of citizens, the population of dangerous objects can be controlled.\r\n\r\n“The visual acuity of young people will allow us to detect weaker, and therefore smaller, asteroids than with traditional image recognition algorithms. The key is to get thousands of citizens involved in the project. It is the task of all to protect the future of our planet and hunters will be our shield against objects that come very close to the Earth\", comments Miquel Serra-Ricart, the astronomer coordinating the project.","keywords":[],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":4,"topic":"Astronomy & Space"},{"id":12,"topic":"Education"}],"start_date":"2016-11-01","end_date":null,"url":"cazasteroides.org","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[],"latitude":"40.405034","longitude":"-3.700149","country":"ES","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-28_070704042424_613_logo-cazasteroides-600-400.png","imageCredit1":"","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-28_070704042424_354_logo-cazasteroides-600-400.png","imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-28_070704042424_707_header-cazasteroides.png","imageCredit3":"","host":"Universidad Politécnica de Madrid","howToParticipate":"Only a mobile phone is required, to download the app Android or iOS, or even from the computer's browser.","doingAtHome":true,"equipment":"Internet.","fundingBody":null,"fundingProgram":"Convocatoria de ayudas 2015 para el fomento de la cultura científica, tecnológica y de la innovación","originDatabase":null,"originURL":"","originUID":"","featured":false,"customField":[],"dateCreated":"2020-04-28T07:19:24.945437Z","origin":""},{"id":39,"name":"Identificación de asteroides cercanos a la Tierra (Near-Earth Asteroids precovery)","aim":"This is an educational programme conducted by the Spanish Virtual Observatory whose main goal is to offer students, amateur astronomers and the public in general the possibility of identifying in astronomical archives asteroids that may hit the Earth.","description":"The Virtual Observatory (VO) is an international initiative whose main goal is to ensure an efficient access and analysis of the information hosted in astronomical archives. In the framework of the Spanish Virtual Observatory we have taken advantage of the VO standards to develop a system to easily access astronomical archives and look for PHAs and  NEAs. At the moment, the public access is limited to the Sloan Digitized Sky Survey (SDSS) and the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS).\r\n\r\nPrecovery is the process of finding an object in astronomical archives generally for the purpose of calculating a more accurate orbit. Calculating the orbit of an astronomical object involves measuring its position on multiple occasions: The more widely separated these are in time, the more accurately the orbit can be calculated. Accurate determination of the orbital parameters is of fundamental importance for objects like asteroids with a non-negligible probability of impacting Earth.\r\n\r\nApophis is an excellent example of how important Precovery can be. Discovered on June 19, 2004, follow-up observations indicated a small probability (up to 2.7%) that it would strike Earth in 2029. It was not until precovery images taken in March 2004 were analyzed when the possibility of an impact on Earth was eliminated.Apophis belongs to the category of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). These objects are characterized by an Earth Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance(MOID) of 0.05 astronomical units (AU) or less and an absolute magnitude (H) of 22.0 or less. This \"potential\" to make close Earth approaches does not mean a PHA will impact Earth. It only means there is a possibility for such a threat. By monitoring these PHAs and updating their orbits, we can better predict the close-approach statistics and thus their Earth-impact threat. The same approach applies for Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), objects whose orbits partly lie between 0.983 and 1.3 astronomical units.","keywords":[{"id":80,"keyword":"astronomy"},{"id":81,"keyword":"asteroids"},{"id":82,"keyword":"virtual observatory"}],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":4,"topic":"Astronomy & Space"},{"id":25,"topic":"Physics"}],"start_date":null,"end_date":null,"url":"","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[],"latitude":"40.489786","longitude":"-3.474598","country":"ES","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_080803030202_557_ast1b.png","imageCredit1":"","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_080803030202_437_logo-svo-ns.png","imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_080803030303_654_ast1b.png","imageCredit3":"","host":"Centro de Astrobiología, Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial INTA-CSIC","howToParticipate":"The procedure of identifying PHAs and NEAs relies on the comparison of images of the same region of the sky taken several minutes apart.

Since some drugs in use have already been shown to be safe enough for human health, they may be available to treat patients with COVID-19 much sooner than a newly created compound and thus accelerate control of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nUnder this premise, the Biophym Group of the Institute of Matter Structure of the CSIC has proposed to perform simulations of the interaction of drugs used against Ebola, HIV infection, influenza or hepatitis B with the replication machinery of the genome of the SARS-Co-V virus. To do this, it will resort to computer techniques and the help of the computers of thousands of volunteers connected through Ibercivis' distributed computing platform. These operations will show if any of the molecules manages to inhibit a key protein in the multiplication of the virus called 'RNA-dependent RNA polymerase'. If so, the drug would become an ideal candidate for testing in human clinical trials.","description":"\"Having effective drugs against the coronavirus is essential to reduce the severity and mortality of the disease,\" explains Javier Martínez de Salazar, leader of the Biophym group. \"The protein selected as a target plays a central role in the replication and transcription of the genetic material of the virus; If it is neutralized, it can slow down the spread of the virus in the body and aid in healing, \"he adds. However, he warns, \"looking for a compound capable of neutralizing a specific protein is like testing a huge number of keys to open a lock and, when this process is simulated by computer means, it requires great computing power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a key in a lock, the effectiveness of a drug depends on how well its structure adapts to that of the area where the protein develops its activity,\" he adds. \"There are physics-chemistry-based models that can predict the efficacy of compounds using computational techniques - called in silico - before they are tested in clinical trials. But these models involve performing hundreds of thousands of calculations to measure the strength of the interaction of each of the possible associations between the drug and the protein, \"says Javier Ramos Díaz, one of the group's researchers.\r\n\r\nThe project will have the support of the thousands of personal computers that are part of Ibercivis' distributed computing platform ('Ibercivis BOINC'), to which anyone who wants to collaborate can join. The operations will be divided into small packages that will be sent to each device. In this way, a computing capacity similar to that of a supercomputer will be achieved and all project activities can be carried out.\r\n\r\nVolunteers only need to download the BOINC program, an open source application developed by the University of Berkeley, and join ‘Ibercivis BOINC’ at the time of installation. By doing so, they will be able to easily choose when and how to participate. For example, whoever does not want the computational capacity of their computer to be affected while using it, just leave the default configuration so that the program runs only during pause times, when the screen saver jumps.","keywords":[{"id":170,"keyword":"covid"},{"id":171,"keyword":"coronavirus"},{"id":172,"keyword":"distributed computing"}],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":7,"topic":"Biology"},{"id":14,"topic":"Genetics"},{"id":17,"topic":"Health & Medicine"},{"id":19,"topic":"Information & Computing sciences"}],"start_date":"2020-04-23","end_date":"2020-09-20","url":"https://ibercivis.es/project/proyecto-covid-phym/","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[{"id":2,"dateCreated":"2021-03-12T16:14:44.312362Z","dateUpdated":"2021-03-12T16:14:44.312375Z","name":"Ibercivis Foundation","url":"ibercivis.es","description":"\r\nIBERCIVIS is the national private non-for-profit foundation devoted to citizen science in Spain.

IBERCIVIS was legally established in 2012 but the consortium has been working closely since 2007 both in Spain and Portugal (see www.ibercivis.pt). Since then, we have deployed more than 60 experiments from 40 different research groups reaching over 60.000 citizen scientists. Ours set of experiments and include volunteer computing (e.g. simulation of nuclear fusion devices yielding on average 8 million hours and 2.3 TFLOPS), volunteer sensing (e.g. odour nuisances reports: OdourCollect), participatory experiments (e.g. human behaviour in dilemma), or collective intelligence projects (e.g. collective music composition) among others. We support groups with hardware (e.g. hosting, load balance, security services), middleware (e.g. tech eulogies such as BOINC, PyBossa, EpiCollect) and software development (e.g. multi device developments or libraries such as gromacs or autodock). Despite ICT and virtual experiments are our focus, due to the digitally enabled borderless transformation of research, reaching new scales of number and range of contributors, we also work offline with expanded laboratories open to the public such as fablabs or wet labs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe deploy, support and promote the general public engagement in science with research and educational purposes. We play a central role in the Citizen Science Community at local, national and international levels. We are the national institution of Spain promoting citizen science and we run the portal Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain (www.ciencia-ciudadana.es) We are part of the steering committee of the European Citizen Science Association, linking it with responsible research and innovation, working on the adaptation of the RRI-Tools self reflection tool for the CitSci communities and #CitSciChatES among other actives. Since 2012 we coordinate the European project Socientize (www.socientize.eu) which delivered the White Paper on Citizen Science for Europe, referenced as a flagship document for the citizen science policy making. IBERCIVIS and Socientize have been referenced as best practices by several institutions and initiatives, highlighting the European Commission, the Australian Citizen Science Association, RRI-Tools, RRI-ICT, Ars Electronica or Cotec Foundation among others.

By studying common garden species and monitoring the effects of actions for wildlife, Naturehood looks to fill this knowledge gap and encourage environmentally aware communities.

The aim of the LandSense project is to build a far-reaching Citizen Observatory for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) monitoring that will also function as a technology innovation marketplace. LandSense deploys advanced tools, services and resources to mobilise and engage citizens to collect in-situ observations (i.e. ground-based data and visual interpretations of EO imagery). Integrating these citizen-driven in-situ data collections with established authoritative and open access data sources will help reduce costs, extend GEOSS and Copernicus capacities, and support comprehensive environmental monitoring systems.","description":"LandSense builds an innovative Citizen Observatory for Land Use & Land Cover (LULC) monitoring, by connecting citizens with satellite imagery to transform current approaches to environmental decision making. LandSense aims to uncover the collective potential of citizen science and Earth observation (EO) data to improve the way people see, map and understand the world. Citizen Observatories are community-driven mechanisms to complement existing systems for improved environmental monitoring. They are fostered through innovative and novel EO mobile applications, allowing citizens to not only play a key role in LULC monitoring, but also to be directly involved in the co-creation of such solutions. LandSense will deploy advanced tools, services and resources to mobilise and engage citizens to collect in-situ observations (i.e. ground-based data and visual interpretations of EO imagery). Integrating these citizen-driven in-situ data collections with established authoritative and open access data sources will help reduce costs, extend GEOSS and Copernicus capacities, and support comprehensive environmental monitoring systems. \r\n\r\nPolicy-relevant campaigns will be implemented in close collaboration with multiple stakeholders to ensure that citizen observations address user requirements and contribute to EU-wide environmental governance and decision-making. Campaigns for addressing local and regional Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) issues are planned for select areas in Austria, France, Germany, Spain, Slovenia and Serbia. Novel LandSense services will be deployed and tested in these areas to address critical LULC issues (i.e. urbanisation, agricultural land use and forest/habitat monitoring). For example, local residents in the cities of Vienna, Amsterdam and Heidelberg will help cooperatively detect and map changes in land cover and green space to address key issues of urban sprawl and land take. Such campaigns are facilitated through numerous pathways of citizen empowerment via the LandSense Engagement Platform, i.e. tools for discussion, online voting collaborative mapping, as well as events linked to public consultation and cooperative planning. In addition to creating tools for data collection, quality assurance, and interaction with the public, the project aims to drive innovation through collaboration with the private sector. LandSense will build an innovation marketplace to attract a vast community of users across numerous disciplines and sectors and boost Europe’s role in the business of ground-based monitoring.","keywords":[{"id":52,"keyword":"earth observation"},{"id":56,"keyword":"innovation"},{"id":57,"keyword":"in-situ monitoring"}],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":1,"topic":"Agriculture & Veterinary science"},{"id":5,"topic":"Biodiversity"},{"id":11,"topic":"Ecology & Environment"},{"id":23,"topic":"Nature & outdoors"},{"id":24,"topic":"Natural resource management"}],"start_date":"2016-09-01","end_date":"2020-08-31","url":"https://landsense.eu/","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[],"latitude":"48.068444","longitude":"16.352119","country":"AT","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_070703035050_859_main_prev.9cef7e9b.jpg","imageCredit1":"","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_070703035050_847_LandSense.3f816bf4.png","imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_070703035050_596_main_prev.9cef7e9b.jpg","imageCredit3":"","host":"IIASA","howToParticipate":"In a nutshell, the LandSense Engagement Platform is the marketplace where citizens can participate in the various Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) related campaigns and interested parties can reuse existing services and register new applications: https://landsense.eu/Project/LEP\r\nUse the power of existing LandSense service and tools to develop your own innovative Citizen Science campaigns that meet your needs and solve your research question: https://landsense.eu/Innovate\r\nParticipate in the LandSense Challenge, which targets individuals, web-entrepreneurs, start-ups and SMEs coming from all participating Horizon 2020 countries, to present innovative IT solutions addressing one of the three LandSense domains:\r\n- Urban Landscape Dynamics\r\n- Agricultural Land Use\r\n- Forest & Habitat Monitoring\r\nhttps://landsense.eu/Challenge","doingAtHome":false,"equipment":"Smartphone, computer and other tech equipment","fundingBody":{"id":6,"body":"European Commission"},"fundingProgram":"H2020-EU.3.5.5.","originDatabase":null,"originURL":"","originUID":"","featured":false,"customField":[],"dateCreated":"2020-03-25T07:24:50.438627Z","origin":""},{"id":157,"name":"Herpterkep","aim":"Mapping herptetofauna of Hungary","description":"Website was started in 2011 with the aim to collect observations on the herpetofauna of Hungary.","keywords":[],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":2,"topic":"Animals"},{"id":21,"topic":"Long-term species monitoring"}],"start_date":"2011-03-01","end_date":null,"url":"https://herpterkep.mme.hu/?lang=en","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[],"latitude":"47.181759","longitude":"19.506094","country":"HU","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-06-30_080806061919_804_Terkepezes-logo_EN.jpg","imageCredit1":"","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-06-30_080806061919_813_Terkepezes-logo.jpg","imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-06-30_080806061919_754_Terkepezes-banner.jpg","imageCredit3":"","host":"MME BirdLife Hungary","howToParticipate":"Anyone can register with e-mail address on the website or by downloading our free Android app. After login, anyone can upload observation.","doingAtHome":true,"equipment":"Smartphone or computer, camera for making picture (observation data with picture as proof is preferred)","fundingBody":null,"fundingProgram":"","originDatabase":null,"originURL":"","originUID":"","featured":false,"customField":[],"dateCreated":"2020-06-30T08:09:19.633441Z","origin":""},{"id":30,"name":"GROW Observatory","aim":"The GROW Observatory is a  Citizens’ Observatory that has empowered people and whole communities to take action on soils and climate across Europe.

This goal can be achieved by developing the following objectives: a) Make Citizen Science and Remote Sensing Phenology monitoring interoperable, b) Improve and encourage the capture of phenology data through Citizen Science, c) Achieve agreement on phenology protocols among multiple stakeholders, d) Increase application of high resolution high level products from remote sensing.\r\nMany elements needed are already in place. On one hand, Catalonia has a long tradition of phenological observations with a group of persistent enthusiasts that has been extended by the EU H2020 Ground Truth 2.0 Citizen Observatory RitmeNatura.cat. On the other hand, the team leading this project has recently stabilised the Catalan Data Cube beginning with the Sentinel-2 Level 2A as the first temporal series available. By using the later, we are going to derive products to determine the areas that are better fit for useful in-situ observations (because they present a clear phenological signal and are in an area known for presenting species easy to observe). In parallel we will generate a new observation protocol of in-situ phenology and we will request RitmeNatura.cat existing participants and new volunteers to use it in the next spring and fall observation campaign. They will be encouraged to provide observations as well as user feedback based on their experience (using a third element already developed by the group: the EU NextGEOSS NiMMbus system). The project will finalize when the results of the user feedback will be applied to improve both, the remote sensing products and the observation protocol for next year. The outcomes of the project will be transferred to the RitmaNatura.cat network for future use and to the remote sensing community as innovative services.","keywords":[{"id":146,"keyword":"Phenology"},{"id":147,"keyword":"Sentinel-2"},{"id":148,"keyword":"Earth Observation"}],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":2,"topic":"Animals"},{"id":5,"topic":"Biodiversity"},{"id":7,"topic":"Biology"},{"id":8,"topic":"Birds"},{"id":10,"topic":"Climate & Weather"},{"id":11,"topic":"Ecology & Environment"},{"id":21,"topic":"Long-term species monitoring"},{"id":23,"topic":"Nature & outdoors"}],"start_date":"2019-09-01","end_date":"2020-12-31","url":"http://ritmenatura.cat/projects/phenotandem/index-eng.htm","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[],"latitude":"41.852309","longitude":"1.574504","country":"ES","image1":null,"imageCredit1":"","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-27_050504043434_13_LogoPhenoTandem.png","imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-27_050504043434_966_aitona_en_flor_744_degradat_panoramic_CD.png","imageCredit3":"@cristina_dm","host":"CREAF","howToParticipate":"","doingAtHome":false,"equipment":"","fundingBody":{"id":24,"body":"European Space Agency (ESA)"},"fundingProgram":"Citizen Science Earth Observation Lab (CSEOL)","originDatabase":null,"originURL":"","originUID":"","featured":false,"customField":[],"dateCreated":"2020-04-27T17:29:44.320762Z","origin":""},{"id":61,"name":"LIFE ESC360 - 360 Volunteers for monitoring forest biodiversity in the Italian Natura 2000 Network","aim":"The aim of the project is to create opportunities for 360 young people of the European Solidarity Corps, by working on the monitoring of protected habitats and species in State Owned Reserves in Italy.

The iSPEX team, led by Frans Snik of Leiden University, analyzed all measurements from three days in 2013 and combined them into unique maps of dust particles above the Netherlands. The results match and sometimes even exceed those of ground-based measurement networks and satellite instruments.\r\n\r\nThe iSPEX maps achieve a spatial resolution as small as 2 kilometers whereas satellite data are much courser. They also fill in blind spots of established ground-based atmospheric measurement networks. The scientific article that presents these first results of the iSPEX project is being published today in Geophysical Research Letters.\r\n\r\nThe iSPEX team developed a new atmospheric measurement method in the form of a low-cost add-on for smartphone cameras [1]. The iSPEX app instructs participants to scan the blue sky while the phone’s built-in camera takes pictures through the add-on. The photos record both the spectrum and the linear polarization [2,3] of the sunlight that is scattered by suspended dust particles, and thus contain information about the properties of these particles. While such properties are difficult to measure, much better knowledge on atmospheric particles is needed to understand their effects on health, climate and air traffic.\r\n\r\nThousands of participants performed iSPEX measurements throughout the Netherlands on three cloud-free days in 2013. This large-scale citizen science experiment allowed the iSPEX team to verify the reliability of this new measurement method.\r\n\r\nAfter a rigorous quality assessment of each submitted data point, measurements recorded in specific areas within a limited amount of time are averaged to obtain sufficient accuracy. Subsequently the data are converted to Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), which is a standardized quantity related to the total amount of atmospheric particles. The iSPEX AOT data match comparable data from satellites and the AERONET ground station at Cabauw, the Netherlands.

Our goal is to gather this information in the form of checklists of birds, archive it, and freely share it to power new data-driven approaches to science, conservation and education. At the same time, we develop tools that make birding more rewarding. From being able to manage lists, photos and audio recordings, to seeing real-time maps of species distribution, to alerts that let you know when species have been seen, we strive to provide the most current and useful information to the birding community.\"\r\n","description":"\"eBird is the world’s largest biodiversity-related citizen science project, with more than 100 million bird sightings contributed each year by eBirders around the world.

Birders enter when, where, and how they went birding, and then fill out a checklist of all the birds seen and heard during the outing. eBird’s free mobile app allows offline data collection anywhere in the world, and the website provides many ways to explore and summarize your data and other observations from the global eBird community. \r\n\r\neBird is available worldwide, comprising a network of local, national, and international partners. eBird directly collaborates with hundreds of partner groups for regional data entry portals, outreach, engagement, and local impact.\r\n\r\nData quality is of critical importance. When entering sightings, observers are presented with a list of likely birds for that date and region. These checklist filters are developed by some of the most knowledgeable bird distribution experts in the world. When unusual birds are seen, or high counts are reported, the regional experts review these records.\r\n\r\neBird data are stored across secure facilities, archived daily, and are freely accessible to anyone. eBird data have been used in hundreds of conservation decisions and peer-reviewed papers, thousands of student projects, and help inform bird research worldwide. \"\r\n","keywords":[],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":5,"topic":"Biodiversity"},{"id":8,"topic":"Birds"},{"id":21,"topic":"Long-term species monitoring"},{"id":23,"topic":"Nature & outdoors"}],"start_date":null,"end_date":null,"url":"https://ebird.org/home","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[],"latitude":"42.472999","longitude":"-76.450304","country":"US","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-07_030304043636_95_216137561.jpg","imageCredit1":"Honza Grünwald","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-07_030304043636_932_ebird-logo-300x300.png","imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-07_030304043737_574_216137561.jpg","imageCredit3":"Honza Grünwald","host":"Cornell Lab of Ornithology","howToParticipate":"There are comprehensive instructions here: https://support.ebird.org/support/home, https://support.ebird.org/support/solutions/articles/48000957911 and a free online training: https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/product/ebird-essentials/\r\n","doingAtHome":true,"equipment":"","fundingBody":null,"fundingProgram":"","originDatabase":null,"originURL":"","originUID":"","featured":false,"customField":[],"dateCreated":"2020-04-07T15:22:37.443338Z","origin":""},{"id":83,"name":"Participatory Lithology","aim":"Classifying rock samples from domestic collections, connecting citizens and chartered geologist with a cool soundtrack as a backdrop.","description":"In this period of forced confinement for many due to the COVID-19 crisis, we decided to launch an exercise called “participatory lithology”.

Lichen occurrence data will be gathered by citizen volunteers using an exclusive app for mobile devices, which guides data collection. \r\nThis project is the continuation of the successful LiquenCity, which through citizen participation from Madrid and Barcelona cities, almost 5000 records of lichens were gathered in both cities in 2018 and 2019. \r\nBesides air quality maps, the project has three specific secondary goals: 1) to raise public awareness of the problem of pollution in cities for public health through the observation of sensitive organisms in an urban ecosystem; 2) to make citizens conscious of the need for pollution mitigation measures; and 3) to spread the knowledge about lichens, their biology and their use as indicator of human perturbances on ecosystems. \r\n","description":"Liquencity·2 represents the continuation of the citizen science LiquenCity (more information at www.liquencity.org), in which more than 2,000 people participated in the cities of Madrid and Barcelona. In this new project, we expand the framework to three new cities in northern Spain: Oviedo, Pamplona and Pontevedra. The following institutions are involved: the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid (CSIC), the Spanish Biodiversity Information Node (GBIF.ES), the University of Vigo, the University of Oviedo, the University of Navarra, the Terrabiota association of Pamplona, the University of Barcelona and the Institute of Marine Sciences (CSIC).\r\nAir pollution is one of the major problems facing big and medium city inhabitants. The burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, heating systems and industry generates numerous contaminating compounds - especially nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter - which suppose a serious problem for human health. It has been demonstrated that, in high concentrations, these compounds generate multiple respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and they are responsible for around 800,000 deaths per year in Europe.\r\nThe grounds of this project are based on the role of lichen species as bioindicators of different levels of air pollution. Lichens are complex symbiotic organisms formed by the union of a fungus and at least one photosynthetic partner, green algae and/or cyanobacteria. Lichens have been used for decades as bioindicators of anthropic disturbances, especially air pollution. Sensibility to disturbances vary among species, though, and it is possible to identify species with a range of preferences regarding levels of certain pollutants. Overall, it is generally accepted that the greater the diversity of lichens, the better the air quality. \r\nLiquencity·2 use nine indicator species growing on trees in each city, which reflect three different levels of tolerance to air pollution. To map species distribution, and therefore air quality history distribution, the project involves the educative communities (teacher training centers, teachers, students mainly from high schools) and other agents in local communities (associations, independent citizens). Using the information provided in our web site (www.liquencity2.org) and the new app for mobile devices, participants can record the observations and take pictures of them, in order to be corroborated by a team of lichen experts. Didactic resources available from the Liquencity·2 webpage allow to work at the classroom topics regarding natural science, air pollution, bioindicator organisms, and lichen biology, enhancing and contributing to the scientific and environmental education of students \r\nInformation gathered in all three cities will help scientists to build detailed maps of air pollution that will be transferred to local stakeholders, schools and NGOs.  Moreover, the lichen observations will be freely available at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).\r\n","keywords":[],"status":{"id":4,"status":"On hold"},"topic":[{"id":5,"topic":"Biodiversity"},{"id":7,"topic":"Biology"},{"id":11,"topic":"Ecology & Environment"},{"id":12,"topic":"Education"},{"id":17,"topic":"Health & Medicine"},{"id":23,"topic":"Nature & outdoors"}],"start_date":"2020-01-01","end_date":"2020-12-31","url":"www.liquencity2.org","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[],"latitude":"40.410302","longitude":"-3.690290","country":"ES","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-29_060604041515_334_DSCF2229.JPG","imageCredit1":"With Liquencity·2 you will record lichens with your mobile phone or tablet","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-29_060604041616_212_Logotipo%20Positivo%20Versio%CC%81n2_02%404x.png","imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-29_060604041717_214_Xanthoria%20parietina%2023.jpg","imageCredit3":"Xanthoria parietina","host":"Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid","howToParticipate":"To join your school/class/association: Contact us at liquencity2@rjb.csic.es\r\nOther citizens: download the app ‘Liquencity2’ from Apple Store/Google Play, install it in your mobile device and register.\r\n","doingAtHome":false,"equipment":"Only a mobile device with camera (smartphone, tablet…) is needed.

Such an organization shows nowadays two main limitations: (1) the slow process of mediatization of academic knowledge, and (2) perceived low impact of such knowledge for society, especially for disciplines in the fields of the social sciences and the humanities (SSH). The importance of the current phenomenon of massive disinformation in democratic societies can be seen as a direct consequence of this problem of the organization of scientific communication.\r\n\r\nTo explore a new model for science communication, the PLACES project proposes to bring together practitioners from the two professional worlds of journalism and SSH research, from the very beginning of knowledge production, in order to make them both co-actors of the overall process. The aim is to break down the silos of research practices, by creating the conditions for a dialogue on the modalities of science production (as opposed to vertical communication characterizing the dissemination mode). From this point of view, the project aims to put into practice collaborations following the model of \"Extreme Citizen Science\".\r\n\r\nTo do so, the PLACES project supports three experimental collaborative researches, each bringing together a SSH researcher and a journalist, with the aim of highlighting the difficulties and obstacles encountered in this type of inter-professional collaboration. In order to synthesize and problematize what has been observed, the three experimental researches are then observed by professional researchers in order to write a research report on the subject and to make proposals for the creation of a specific platform supporting this type of collaboration.","description":"The first goal of the PLACES project is to bring social science and humanities (SSH) researchers and journalists to work hand in hand on the same research, i.e. to define a subject of study, to explore a field and produce a common analysis, or even to shape together the final product that will be disseminated. Three experimental investigations have been engaged. The first explored the life of young people (under 50) with Alzheimer's disease, producing a final podcast series broadcasted by Binge Audio. The second explored the issue of migration effects during a municipal election in a border area between France and Italy, leading to a series of three press articles on Cafébabel.com. The third investigation, explores the issue of \"false periods\" induced in women by contraceptive pills, and will be published by 20 Minutes France. \r\n\r\nThe second goal of the PLACES project is to observe these collaborations between SSH researchers and journalists at work during their implementation, in order to identify the obstacles, the needs for support, and the successes of such collaborations, and the way they can provide a model for renewing the communication of research. These observations are carried out by a team of two researchers, one in language sciences and the other in anthropology. Their analyses will be published in the form of a research report.\r\n\r\nThe third goal is to draft specifications for the creation of a platform supporting the close collaboration of SSH researchers and journalists involved in a joint research project. The challenge here is to provide the participants first of all with a privileged communication channel as well as a database of different resources needed, but also a toolbox for applications facilitating data sharing and, more largely, collaborative work.\r\n","keywords":[{"id":114,"keyword":"Digital Platform"},{"id":158,"keyword":"Journalism"},{"id":159,"keyword":"Cooperative Survey"}],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":19,"topic":"Information & Computing sciences"},{"id":27,"topic":"Social sciences"}],"start_date":"2019-01-01","end_date":"2020-12-31","url":"https://places.hypotheses.org/","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[],"latitude":"48.856697","longitude":"2.351462","country":"FR","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-06-13_070706060303_39_The%20New%20York%20Times%20on%20the%20New%20Art%20of%20Flickr_1380_1.jpg","imageCredit1":"","image2":null,"imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-05-16_010105052121_521_The%20New%20York%20Times%20on%20the%20New%20Art%20of%20Flickr_1380_1.jpg","imageCredit3":"","host":"EHESS","howToParticipate":"","doingAtHome":false,"equipment":"","fundingBody":{"id":27,"body":"Ministère de la Culture et de la communication - République Française"},"fundingProgram":"Fonds de soutien à l'émergence et à l'innovation dans la presse","originDatabase":null,"originURL":"","originUID":"","featured":false,"customField":[],"dateCreated":"2020-06-19T09:24:07.915550Z","origin":""},{"id":154,"name":"Community Drive","aim":"The overall aim of Community DRive is to educate young people to solve authentic complex problems and transform cities through open data driven methods by breaking boundaries between research institutions, local communities and local governments through the involvement of new types of actors, forms of knowledge and institutions. ","description":"Elementary school and educational institutions are challenged by not adequately educating children and young people for self-knowledge and solving complex societal challenges. At the same time involving citizens and communities outside traditional research institutions as participants in research systems and professional development has been defined as a megatrend that will influence future research policy. The project Community Drive is in scope with the topic by addressing research-based education development. The project involves phases with initial theoretical and research mapping of the field Citizen Science and Community driven science as well as phases with concrete development and interventions on schools in vulnerable districts in Copenhagen. The project address three overall challenges: \r\n\r\nChallenge 1 addresses the need to develop student skills in solving complex problems. The need to identify key competencies of the future has been the subject of education policy debate for several years. Citizen awareness and innovation and learning skills are highlighted as key conditions of collaboration between students and actors across institutions and disciplines. In Community Drive, a range of tools will be developed based on cases involving 21st century skills and design thinking.\r\n\r\nChallenge 2 addresses the development of a more open and engaged research community. Open research is, first and foremost, a research agenda that can have a greater impact on society. Although it was primarily related to scientific publishing (open access), it also encourages knowledge sharing and involvement among users. Involvement of children and young people in teaching shows great educational potential and a strong motivation for students to participate in authentic research and development processes in collaboration with professional actors. Community Drive investigates how collaboration can be based on citizens’ expertise and professionals’ skills. \r\n\r\nChallenge 3 deals with the city’s big open data and citizen involvement in urban development. The smart city and smart society are well-known concepts related to information and communication technology. The collection of information about the city’s “status” can,in collaboration with citizens, be used to optimise resources and offer citizens new and better services. Coommunity Drive focus on the many types of data obtained in a city and the way to enable citizens to collect relevant data about the city. In particular, it will examine how existing data can be represented and applied by both students and other actors. This will contribute to the development of not only smart cities, but also smart citizens.

However, its social relevance should be one a starting point. For the public, neither the understanding of the results, nor the processes that led to them, are trivial tasks. This is even more relevant when there is a large increase in scientific production. One way to address this challenge, used by research institutes, is to produce press releases, hoping that social media will echo them. Although this formula has obvious advantages, its randomness and the short-term effect, for example, leads to several limitations and tends to have limited duration and reduced impact on the public lacking awareness of astronomy. Thus, there is an urgent need to create mechanisms / strategies that quickly disseminate results of scientific innovation without discouraging, in the process, the promotion of positive attitudes towards science and the nature of science itself. However, the question is how to do this with the limited human resources and funding normally associated with outreach. To respond to these challenges CoAstro emerged: a citizen science project that aimed the idealization, implementation and evaluation of a scientific dissemination mechanism that would allow the flow of results and scientific processes between researchers and the public, through the involvement of dissemination structures (already present in research institutes) and non-scientific participants (teachers).","description":"The high scientific production in astronomy impel us to find new ways to carry out scientific dissemination of content, but also, of processes. Thus, we can promote positive attitudes towards science and the public can more easily deal with bad science, scientific fraud and fake news. In this context CoAstro: @n Astronomy Condo emerged – a citizen science project that directly connected four astronomers, nine elementary school teachers, four science disseminators and one mediator. CoAstro´s, whose first edition lasted an academic year, scientific content and processes were appropriated and integrated by teachers in school initiatives, reaching approximately one thousand people.\r\nTeachers' involvement in astronomy research took place in two sub-projects: “Stars” and “Planets”. In the first, teachers analyzed standard stellar spectra that allow the qualitative and quantitative composition determination of 57000 stars. In addition, they determined star luminosity using Data Release 2 from the European Space Agency – ESA – GAIA Mission. In the planets project the team started with the production of a planetary transit video, through the Python program. Then, teachers analyzed curves to signal the presence of potential exoplanets. In the process, the mediator was integrated: he adapted the language and created “guidelines for research tasks”. He also ensured the maintenance of the collaborative work, articulating the challenges of research, dissemination and teaching.\r\nThe scientific analysis of CoAstro's results was achieved by implementing a qualitative research. The data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and observations. Results showed high improvements in teachers’ substantive and processual knowledge; positive change in epistemological attitudes and beliefs towards astronomy; as well as, the increasing of the quality of teachers’ scientific dissemination practices.\r\nData from astronomers and disseminators, showed one main difference: science disseminators (unlike astronomers), have not changed their perception about teachers´ professional class, due to their participation in CoAstro. Indeed, both groups agree that the project: i) was useful (and facilitated) astronomy dissemination work; ii) it was an opportunity for teachers to increase their procedural knowledge about astronomy; iii) was, at the outset, risky, because of its idea of involving teachers in real astronomy research; iv) reinforced their own perception about the importance and purposes of dissemination practices, promoting new communication skills and new ways of structuring astronomy dissemination activities.\r\nAlthough with some implementation difficulties (time, adequacy of tasks ...) CoAstro allowed us to understand how a citizen science project can contribute, with lasting and wide-public-ranging effects, to open the school to the surrounding community and vice-versa and how the public can open up to astronomy research and the latter to the public.","keywords":[{"id":131,"keyword":"Astronomy"}],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":4,"topic":"Astronomy & Space"},{"id":12,"topic":"Education"}],"start_date":"2018-10-15","end_date":null,"url":"https://condominio.astro.up.pt/","mainOrganisation":null,"organisation":[],"latitude":"41.150934","longitude":"-8.638451","country":"PT","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-07_070704041818_108_Planetario_CoAstro_HD.png","imageCredit1":"","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-07_070704041919_225_COASTRO_FUNDOBRANCO.png","imageCredit2":"","image3":null,"imageCredit3":"","host":"CAUP / IA / FCUP / PP-CCV","howToParticipate":"Apply here: https://condominio.astro.up.pt/?page_id=264","doingAtHome":true,"equipment":"Personal computer without the need for any special specifications or software.","fundingBody":null,"fundingProgram":"","originDatabase":null,"originURL":"","originUID":"","featured":false,"customField":[],"dateCreated":"2020-07-24T08:48:53.285386Z","origin":""},{"id":109,"name":"CrowdWater","aim":"CrowdWater stands for an independent and reliable data collection by citizens for modelling of floods and droughts and as a supplement to existing measurements.

IBERCIVIS was legally established in 2012 but the consortium has been working closely since 2007 both in Spain and Portugal (see www.ibercivis.pt). Since then, we have deployed more than 60 experiments from 40 different research groups reaching over 60.000 citizen scientists. Ours set of experiments and include volunteer computing (e.g. simulation of nuclear fusion devices yielding on average 8 million hours and 2.3 TFLOPS), volunteer sensing (e.g. odour nuisances reports: OdourCollect), participatory experiments (e.g. human behaviour in dilemma), or collective intelligence projects (e.g. collective music composition) among others. We support groups with hardware (e.g. hosting, load balance, security services), middleware (e.g. tech eulogies such as BOINC, PyBossa, EpiCollect) and software development (e.g. multi device developments or libraries such as gromacs or autodock). Despite ICT and virtual experiments are our focus, due to the digitally enabled borderless transformation of research, reaching new scales of number and range of contributors, we also work offline with expanded laboratories open to the public such as fablabs or wet labs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe deploy, support and promote the general public engagement in science with research and educational purposes. We play a central role in the Citizen Science Community at local, national and international levels. We are the national institution of Spain promoting citizen science and we run the portal Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain (www.ciencia-ciudadana.es) We are part of the steering committee of the European Citizen Science Association, linking it with responsible research and innovation, working on the adaptation of the RRI-Tools self reflection tool for the CitSci communities and #CitSciChatES among other actives. Since 2012 we coordinate the European project Socientize (www.socientize.eu) which delivered the White Paper on Citizen Science for Europe, referenced as a flagship document for the citizen science policy making. IBERCIVIS and Socientize have been referenced as best practices by several institutions and initiatives, highlighting the European Commission, the Australian Citizen Science Association, RRI-Tools, RRI-ICT, Ars Electronica or Cotec Foundation among others. IBERCIVIS has been marked as good practice in several scenarios, including open governance and grass-roots initiatives. We set up the interaction between science and society for scientific policy making in Socientize. In addition to create the inclusive scenarios for citizen-lead projects, we support social innovation by providing scientific resources and equipment for citizen involvement in scientific research.\r\n\r\n\r\n","logo":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-07_101009094141_643_LOGO_DEF_1.png","contactPoint":"Francisco Sanz","contactPointEmail":"info@ibercivis.es","latitude":"41.684275","longitude":"-0.887436","country":"ES","creator":1,"orgType":2},"organisation":[],"latitude":"41.659421","longitude":"-0.898213","country":"ES","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_060603031414_789_cropped-workshop-Nora-Salas-Seoane.png","imageCredit1":"","image2":null,"imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_060603031414_337_cropped-workshop-Nora-Salas-Seoane.png","imageCredit3":"","host":"Ibercivis Foundation","howToParticipate":"  ...","doingAtHome":true,"equipment":"<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\"><div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">A mobile and your nose</div></div>","fundingBody":{"id":6,"body":"European Commission"},"fundingProgram":"","originDatabase":null,"originURL":"","originUID":"","featured":false,"customField":[],"dateCreated":"2020-09-08T01:32:12.844112Z","origin":""},{"id":18,"name":"WeObserve","aim":"<p>WeObserve – An Ecosystem of Citizen Observatories for Environmental Monitoring –improves the coordination between Citizen Observatories and regional, European and international activities to tackle and research three key challenges that Citizen Observatories face: awareness, acceptability and sustainability.

But plastic pollution on beaches and riverbanks in Europe also doesn’t stop at man-made borders. For this reason, avoiding micro- and macroplastics in the environment, a scientific approach to this challenge and researching sustainable materials are tasks which we Europeans must take on together.\r\n\r\nAs part of their joint Trio-Presidency of the Council of the European Union for 2020 and 2021, Germany, Portugal and Slovenia are advocating particularly for clean seas, ocean and rivers, as well as the nature surrounding these waters. At the same time, school classes and youth groups are called upon to collect plastic waste along the banks of rivers and streams, to document the various types of the plastic waste collected at different points of a section of a river and actively support research as part of this international citizen science campaign. \r\n\r\nAre you a teacher or a leader of a youth group? Have you found a suitable stretch along a river or stream? Then you can get started! Using the detailed project materials, the types of waste identified by the individual groups (e.g. cigarette butts, pieces of film or packaging) are published on a digital map, thus assisting the scientific community in gradually closing gaps in the existing research on the amount of different types of plastic waste. The fight against pollution from plastic waste, for cleaner water and for preserving natural resources for future generations in a united Europe can only be a success if we – the citizens – actively support joint political initiatives in the places we live.\r\n\r\nPlastic Pirates – Go Europe! Are you on board?\r\n","description":"Water makes up nearly two-thirds of the earth’s surface, and seas and the ocean have an enormous impact on the stability of our climate. Due to their diversity, bodies of water around the globe are a unique habitat for flora and fauna. If you live inland, far from the nearest sea, you may be asking yourselves what this all has to do with you? A lot!\r\nIt may start with small rivers further inland that connect to other rivers, but they eventually reach the sea. Need an example? The Danube, Europe’s longest river, flows through a total of ten different countries before reaching the Black Sea after traversing some 2,850 kilometres. Unfortunately, it’s not just ships, fish and plant remains that make their way to the sea via rivers. Different types of plastic waste as well – particles hardly visible to the human eye as well as yogurt pots or entire plastic bags in equal measure – ultimately find their way to the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe task\r\nIn 2020, ‘capturing’ this waste on the riverbanks and near bodies of water becomes the Europe-wide task of the Plastic Pirates. By collecting plastic waste and uploading data on the amount of waste found, you – together with your school class or extracurricular youth group – can help conduct research on the pollution of bodies of water. You will use a range of methods to understand the pollution by waste in and around the river and to record your findings. The project booklet contains specific instructions for each method. You split into sub-groups, as different groups will tackle different aspects of the study. Uniform experimental guidelines and working steps for all teams which participate ensure that, throughout Europe, the data collected is comparable and will become visible step by step on an online map.\r\nOn the one hand, the joint campaign of the ministries of education, science and research of the three countries is intended to raise awareness throughout Europe for the importance of rivers as common lifelines, as well as for protecting our natural resources. On the other hand, the campaign aims to emphasize the importance of international research collaboration. \r\n\r\n","keywords":[{"id":14,"keyword":"Ocean"},{"id":22,"keyword":"Environment"},{"id":167,"keyword":"plastics"},{"id":168,"keyword":"single-use"}],"status":{"id":3,"status":"Periodically active"},"topic":[{"id":11,"topic":"Ecology & Environment"},{"id":12,"topic":"Education"},{"id":22,"topic":"Ocean, Water, Marine & Terrestrial"},{"id":23,"topic":"Nature & outdoors"}],"start_date":"2016-06-01","end_date":"2022-03-31","url":"www.plastic-pirates.eu","mainOrganisation":{"id":46,"dateCreated":"2020-10-05T10:25:50.579800Z","dateUpdated":"2020-10-05T10:25:50.579839Z","name":"Ecologic Institute","url":"https://www.ecologic.eu/","description":"Ecologic Institute is an independent, academic think tank for environmental research and policy analysis.

IBERCIVIS board is formed by the Ministry of Innovation and Competitiveness of Spain, the regional Government of Aragon, CSIC, CIEMAT, University of Zaragoza and the Zaragoza City of Knowledge Foundation. IBERCIVIS was legally established in 2012 but the consortium has been working closely since 2007 both in Spain and Portugal (see www.ibercivis.pt). Since then, we have deployed more than 60 experiments from 40 different research groups reaching over 60.000 citizen scientists. Ours set of experiments and include volunteer computing (e.g. simulation of nuclear fusion devices yielding on average 8 million hours and 2.3 TFLOPS), volunteer sensing (e.g. odour nuisances reports: OdourCollect), participatory experiments (e.g. human behaviour in dilemma), or collective intelligence projects (e.g. collective music composition) among others. We support groups with hardware (e.g. hosting, load balance, security services), middleware (e.g. tech eulogies such as BOINC, PyBossa, EpiCollect) and software development (e.g. multi device developments or libraries such as gromacs or autodock). Despite ICT and virtual experiments are our focus, due to the digitally enabled borderless transformation of research, reaching new scales of number and range of contributors, we also work offline with expanded laboratories open to the public such as fablabs or wet labs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe deploy, support and promote the general public engagement in science with research and educational purposes. We play a central role in the Citizen Science Community at local, national and international levels. We are the national institution of Spain promoting citizen science and we run the portal Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain (www.ciencia-ciudadana.es) We are part of the steering committee of the European Citizen Science Association, linking it with responsible research and innovation, working on the adaptation of the RRI-Tools self reflection tool for the CitSci communities and #CitSciChatES among other actives. Since 2012 we coordinate the European project Socientize (www.socientize.eu) which delivered the White Paper on Citizen Science for Europe, referenced as a flagship document for the citizen science policy making. IBERCIVIS and Socientize have been referenced as best practices by several institutions and initiatives, highlighting the European Commission, the Australian Citizen Science Association, RRI-Tools, RRI-ICT, Ars Electronica or Cotec Foundation among others. IBERCIVIS has been marked as good practice in several scenarios, including open governance and grass-roots initiatives. We set up the interaction between science and society for scientific policy making in Socientize. In addition to create the inclusive scenarios for citizen-lead projects, we support social innovation by providing scientific resources and equipment for citizen involvement in scientific research.\r\n\r\n\r\n","logo":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-07_101009094141_643_LOGO_DEF_1.png","contactPoint":"Francisco Sanz","contactPointEmail":"info@ibercivis.es","latitude":"41.684275","longitude":"-0.887436","country":"ES","creator":1,"orgType":2},"organisation":[],"latitude":"41.662144","longitude":"-0.879606","country":"ES","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_050503034545_648_Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202020-03-24%2006-34-04.png","imageCredit1":"","image2":null,"imageCredit2":"","image3":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_050503034545_261_Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202020-03-24%2006-34-04.png","imageCredit3":"","host":"Unizar, Ibercivis","howToParticipate":"..","doingAtHome":true,"equipment":"","fundingBody":{"id":5,"body":"Fecyt-Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología"},"fundingProgram":"","originDatabase":null,"originURL":"","originUID":"","featured":false,"customField":[],"dateCreated":"2020-09-08T01:30:31.667409Z","origin":""},{"id":125,"name":"Plastic Spotter","aim":"Investigate how much plastic can be found in the canals and other waters of the city Leiden in the Netherlands.

For example, understanding how the adaptation process occurs can help explain how viruses infect new hosts or how bacteria can resist the effects of certain antibiotics; as well as how some cells can adapt and resist chemotherapy treatments, and how pests can adapt and develop resistance to certain insecticides. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the genetic basis of adaptation can provide us with relevant insight into areas of high economic and social impact, such as medicine, health, agriculture, and climate change. A greater understanding of each of these issues brings enormous potential for achieving greater social well-being.\r\n\r\nTo understand how organisms adapt to the environment, we must first identify what is changing within the organism and how it is changing. In biological terms, this means identifying which genes are involved in the process of change, and what molecular mechanisms they are acting through.\r\n\r\nTo do this, it is necessary to analyze organisms that both live in, and are exposed to, different environmental conditions, sequencing their genomes, and identifying changes or mutations. A suitable organism to carry out these types of genetic studies is a fruit fly that goes by the scientific name, Drosophila.\r\n","description":"The Citizen Science Project Melanogaster: Catch The Fly!

Our research addresses an urgent need for multi- and interdisciplinary research to understand emerging possibilities of the practice and to provide scientific evidence for decision-making in the EU. The envisaged opportunities of our idea are many, ranging from a closer connection of the affected people to environmental litigation, to a wider, more diverse and inclusive availability of evidence on critical environmental issues, to the possibility of even mitigating the conflict.","description":"On June 27, 2019, a landmark court decision was released in Texas, in which a judge found the petrochemical company Formosa Plastics Corporation, liable for violating the Clean Water Act because of plastic discharge into local waters. The case was brought by a civic group based in part on citizen sensed-evidence which involved volunteer observations performed over years. This practice entailing grassroots-driven environmental monitoring could be qualified as ‘Citizen Science’ and, more specifically, ‘Citizen Sensing’. The contamination could not be proved through existing data held by competent authorities since the company never filed any record of pollution with the competent authority. Rather, the monitoring and data collection was almost entirely conducted by local residents.\r\nCases such as the Formosa litigation are expected to increase drastically. They pose urgent research questions. Above all, the case motivates an investigation of the potential of introducing Citizen Sensing as a source of evidence in litigation over environmental wrongdoings. Furthermore, Citizen Sensing may also play a role in avoiding the court stage, as a tool to mediate the environmental conflict and to steer the responsible company to adopt an environmentally-compliant behaviour.\r\nRelated research is still in its infancy. The few championing actors in the debate are located in the U.S., not flanked by a parallel inquiry from the European perspective. The key objective of the Sensing for Justice project is to fill this knowledge gap in order to avoid a possible scientific and legislative vacuum, and provide newly required research capacity in the EU.\r\nThe research will be hosted by the European Commission Joint Research Centre, currently leading actor in the research on Citizen Science for environmental monitoring and reporting, which will allow me to play a crucial role in the enactment of measures to release Citizen Science for litigation and mediation’s potential across the EU.","keywords":[{"id":5,"keyword":"Monitoring"},{"id":22,"keyword":"Environment"},{"id":40,"keyword":"citizen science"},{"id":136,"keyword":"Environmental Justice"}],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":11,"topic":"Ecology & Environment"},{"id":27,"topic":"Social sciences"}],"start_date":"2020-06-01","end_date":"2022-08-31","url":"https://sensingforjustice.webnode.it/","mainOrganisation":{"id":38,"dateCreated":"2020-09-17T17:58:55.417751Z","dateUpdated":"2020-09-17T17:58:55.417794Z","name":"The European Commission Joint Research Centre","url":"https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en","description":"The Joint Research Centre (JRC) is the European Commission's science and knowledge service which employs scientists to carry out research in order to provide independent scientific advice and support to EU policy.","logo":null,"contactPoint":"dr.

In the context of the 21st century networked society, new and exciting opportunities to use technologies such as Web 2.0, social networking platforms, mobile phones, web communities, and the internet-of-things provide the opportunity to fulfill a cutting edge version of Dewey’s vision. Taking Citizen Science to School (TCSS) capitalizes on affordances of the networked society to break boundaries between traditional silos — students, citizens, and scientists; formal and informal learning; science and data literacies; classrooms and out-of-school environments; physical and online spaces; educational researchers and practitioners; science and science-education. Specifically, by engaging students within citizen science projects, this initiative aims to elucidate how breaking boundaries between traditional silos fosters meaningful STEM learning.\r\n\r\nTaking Citizen Science to School is guided by three mutually-enriching goals. These include:\r\n(1) Developing and substantiating a conceptual framework of meaningful STEM learning through student engagement in citizen science.\r\n(2) Generating principled practical knowledge through a network of research-practice partnerships that build school capacity for sustaining the innovation.\r\n(3) Engaging middle and high school students in real and ongoing scientific endeavors through technology-enhanced learning environments.","logo":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-16_101009094747_242_TCSS%20Logo%20-%20For%20Light%20Backgrounds.png","contactPoint":"Dr. Ornit Sagy","contactPointEmail":"tcss.center@gmail.com","latitude":"32.761629","longitude":"35.019863","country":"IL","creator":1325,"orgType":3},"organisation":[],"latitude":"32.834308","longitude":"35.040894","country":"IL","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-21_121209095050_388_sleeing.jpg","imageCredit1":"Tom Cohen","image2":null,"imageCredit2":"","image3":null,"imageCredit3":"","host":null,"howToParticipate":"The project is designed for middle and high school students.

ESSRG interprets and synthesises the gathered data in order to gain a better understanding of self-provisioning practices. While testing the tool, Járókelőkutató is introduced to the wider circle of NGOs and citizen science initiatives in Hungary as an available tool for adapting further bottom-up citizen science projects.\r\n\r\nThe pilot project was developed via several discussions taking place among ESSRG researchers and Járókelő developers. Desk research was conducted on food-related citizen science tools before it gained its final shape. Due to COVID-19, the theme of food sovereignty received more attention as a concept. The present tool not only serves as a pilot of the freshly developed tool but it also reflects on what has stood out as a highly appreciated food production practice during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nJárókelőkutató enables citizens to share their observations in relation to their homegrown plants, vegetables, fruits and seeds. Video recording allows one to share their gardening methods and practices. In its current form, Járókelőkutató citizen science tool is available in forms of an online platform via PC.\r\n","description":"‘Járókelőkutató’ (Passer-by Researcher) is co-created citizen science digital tool, grown out of a fruitful collaboration between ESSRG and the local NGO, ‘Járókelő’ (Passer-by) Public Benefit Association.

However, there is a lack of information from a few meters from the coastline where the largest plastic mass flux is suspected to occur. The reason behind is the general use of manta trawls towed by boats or research vessels to obtain samples, which hinders nearshore sampling. We have designed a manta trawl to collect samples in the near-shore from any type of recreational sports floating gear like kayaks, sailboats, rowing boats, windsurf boards and others. Data generated is comparable to that obtained with traditional scientific equipment towed from boats. During one year, starting from October 2020, 10 social, environmental or sports associations along the NW Mediterranean coast will be acquiring scientific samples in the nearshore within the frame of two citizen science monitoring projects lead by the Spanish delegation of the non-governmental organization Surfrider Foundation Europe and the University of Barcelona. The projects &ldquo;Paddle Surfing for Science&rdquo; and &ldquo;PlastiPlancton BCN&rdquo; represent a paradigm shift in microplastic research, allowing to fill the gap in knowledge of this transition coastal area, and actively involving citizens in the generation of new monitoring data.</p>\r\n","keywords":[],"status":{"id":2,"status":"Active"},"topic":[{"id":11,"topic":"Ecology & Environment"},{"id":22,"topic":"Ocean, Water, Marine & Terrestrial"}],"start_date":"2020-10-01","end_date":"2021-11-01","url":"https://surfingforscience.org/","mainOrganisation":{"id":60,"dateCreated":"2020-11-04T06:35:04.459879Z","dateUpdated":"2020-11-04T06:35:04.459944Z","name":"Universitat de Barcelona","url":"https://www.ub.edu/","description":"The University of Barcelona (UB) is a public university located in the city of Barcelona, Catalonia in Spain.
