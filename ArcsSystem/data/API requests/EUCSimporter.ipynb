Rapidamente constituiu-se num caso de sucesso de comunicação de ciência e de promoção da saúde. O projecto holandês, entretanto alargado à Bélgica que fala flamengo, motivou investigadores do Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) a encetar uma colaboração internacional que veio dar lugar, em 2005, ao Gripenet português.\\r\\nAcompanhando a  actividade esperada da gripe, o Gripenet recolhe dados de Novembro a Abril. É com base nesses dados, recolhidos em questionários on-line, que é feita a monitorização da epidemia sazonal. Contudo, o site www.gripenet.pt, que serve de suporte ao projecto, está activo durante todo o ano de forma a fornecer informação sobre a doença e as temáticas com ela envolvidas. O site do Gripenet é o maior repositório de conteúdos on-line em língua portuguesa sobre a gripe.\\r\\nTodos podem participar na monitorização Gripenet. Basta residirem em território nacional e possuir endereço de correio electrónico. Depois de se registarem no site, os participantes recebem semanalmente uma newsletter com curiosidades e notícias sobre a gripe e são convidados a preencher, em alguns segundos, um pequeno questionário sobre os sintomas gripais (ou ausência deles) da semana anterior.

This plant blindness can be explained by a lack of interest in and focus on plant science in education in favour of animals. However, most life on earth, including humans, depend mainly on plants for food and shelter. Consequently, it is important for society to acknowledge the importance of plants and combat plant blindness. City sidewalk plant communities survive despite the extreme stress factors of urban environments, for instance, drought, access to little soil, high levels of manual disturbance and herbicides. Therefore, these plants are highly adaptable and could show how plants change and survive in extreme environments. Previous studies in urban ecology have shown that plant species richness, and anthropogenic factors can best explain biodiversity. These factors and their role in plant species composition, richness and diversity needs further study to infer which species or species communities are highly successful in these challenging urban environments. To understand the ecology of urban plant communities could help us design sustainable and biodiverse green cities in the future.',\n",

We believe this will generate new knowledge and understanding of plants in citizens and for science. \\r\\nThe project will be easy to participate in and as inclusive as possible. Participants of all ages are welcome to participate only once or many times and potentially become part of the on- and offline Stoepplanten citizen science community. During this project we want all the monitoring data to be open access and available for citizens to play with. We want to encourage citizens to come up with their own research questions and coach or enable them to work with the data to potentially answer these questions. \\r\\nWe also aim for citizens to become more engaged with their direct environment and observe the cities street management, research what is done and to what effect so they can be empowered to take action within their municipality. They could then write an informed petition or get politically active in any way to potentially change street management for more sustainable, biodiverse and green cities and towns.\\r\\nThe aim is also to increase the interest for plants and combat plant blindness. The research questions therefore include the motivation, change in attitude towards plants, knowledge about plants in the participating citizen scientists. Along the development of this citizen science project we aim to organize focus groups including scientists, citizen scientists and policy makers to constantly improve our practices.\\r\\nThis citizen science project is the key endeavor of a PhD project.

       "  'aim': 'Europe has invested a significant amount of resources in infrastructure and services in order to achieve an autonomous, accurate and comprehensive Earth observation capacity. Environmental monitoring systems, such as Copernicus Corine Land Cover, produce a variety of valuable datasets, offered for the entire EU landscape. Yet, the update rate is scarce due to increased costs and timely data validation procedures, while investing in additional in-situ equipment or in maintaining the current infrastructure is unsustainable. Citizen science constitutes an innovative approach of environmental monitoring, capable to complement the existing Earth Observation and in-situ infrastructure with up-to-date information about local ecosystems.  The majority of citizens however, both as individuals and as groups quite often feel disengaged from influencing environmental policies, whilst also remain unaware of publicly available information and initiatives. \\r\\nSCENT Citizen Observatory project has created a toolbox (https://scent-project.eu/scent-toolbox) of smart collaborative technologies and applications that aims to engage citizens with environmental monitoring, enabling them to become the ‘eyes’ of the policy makers and local authorities. Citizens are using low-cost equipment to collect various environmental information (land cover/use, river parameters, soil conditions), that are consolidated to improve flood modelling and are offered to the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) in an interoperable way, following common environmental standards (Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards). ',\n",
       "  'description': 'The project designed, developed and implemented a people-centric observation web, formulated on the basis of using low-cost, portable sensors and innovative applications.  The SCENT toolbox offers various capabilities involving crowdsourcing and serious gaming mechanisms towards enabling, incentivising and increasing the involvement of citizens as individuals and/or citizen groups/associations in the process of environmental monitoring. By using their smartphones and portable sensors, citizens can take images of land cover / land use while walking around in their city or the countryside, report events that may affect floods (e.g. river obstacles) and measure water level, flow velocity and soil moisture, without complex or bulky equipment. They are doing this in a playful manner, through a game of ‘catching’ animated animals in their surroundings and collecting points. \\r\\nOn top of that, novel frameworks are employed to ensure the management, quality control and interoperability of citizen-generated data, coupled with machine learning frameworks that extract valuable information from the collected resources and thus lead to better use of available data, repositories and in-situ monitoring systems. Last but not least, apart from extending the in-situ infrastructure with citizen-sourced observations, the use of the latter was demonstrated in the context of creating flood models and land cove / use maps of enhanced characteristics that can improve decision making.  \\r\\nAdditionally, the value of the SCENT toolbox was demonstrated in two regions in real but diverse examples where flood monitoring is of great importance. The first region is the wetland of Danube Delta in Romania, where flooding is a necessary and beneficial part of maintaining the ecosystem, and the second is the Kifisos River basin around the urban landscape of Athens in Greece, where flooding is a major problem for the local communities.\\r\\nVarious citizen-science campaigns (10 in total) were conducted during 2018 & 2019 in these regions. These field campaigns were organised in different periods in both pilots covering in total 11 months, while focusing on themes of interest to the local communities and the policy makers such as the collection of LC/LU elements, river parameters and soil measurements. The objective of the campaigns was to collect valuable environmental information, at frequent time intervals, that could be further analysed and used. \\r\\nMore than 700 volunteers participated in the field campaigns, testing, evaluating and validating the SCENT toolbox, while also contributing with a significant amount of 24200+ environmental resources in both pilot areas. It should be noted, that SCENT has at the same time established an active online community, involving, as of August 2019, 1130+ active registered users of its public facing applications (SCENT Explore, SCENT Collaborate, SCENT Measure, https://scent-project.eu/scent-toolbox).

       "  'description': 'Sharks and rays have been present on earth for nearly half a billion years, with more than 1,250 extant species. The pivotal importance of cartilaginous fish for marine ecosystems is highlighted by the fact that most shark and some ray species constitute top predators, thus possess central and stabilizing functions in marine food webs. Based on the latest report of IUCN at least half of the rays (50%, 16 of 32 species) in the Mediterranean Sea face an elevated risk of extinction, as well as 54% of sharks (22 of 41). The principal driver for this is overfishing along with the life history characteristics of these species (low reproductive, slow growth rates and long life spans). In Greek Seas at least 67 species of cartilaginous fish are present but existing knowledge on their distribution, ecology and biology is still limited. In Cyprus, studies related to the presence/biology of cartilaginous fish are limited and deficient. Around 30 species of cartilaginous fish have been reported to be present in Cypriot waters to date. \\r\\n\\r\\nM.E.C.O. (Mediterranean Elasmobranchs Citizen Observations) is a Mediterranean initiative which aims to create a network of Mediterranean elasmobranch sightings data, through a collaboration between different teams in various countries, to better understand the occurrence, seasonality and distribution of elasmobranchs in this region. The project \"Sharks and Rays in Greece and Cyprus\" is part of M.E.C.O. and it aims at recording observations of sharks and rays from Greece and Cyprus through the help of sea user citizen scientists. The data will be used to study the distribution and biology of these species. \\r\\n',\n",

Participants in these projects play an invaluable role in facilitating research for little or no obvious reward.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch has been carried out into the motivations of citizen scientists and most of these studies have found that participants are motivated to take part because of altruistic reasons, that is, they want to help scientists and make a contribution to the advancement of their research. Many participants in citizen science have an underlying interest in the topic of the research and gravitate towards projects that are in disciplines of interest to them. Folding@home is no different in that respect. Research carried out recently on over 400 active participants revealed that they wanted to help make a contribution to research and that many had friends or relatives affected by the diseases that the Folding@home scientists investigate.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Have you ever walked around the city in the summer? Then you know it can get very hot because of all the asphalt and the concrete that retains the heat! Staying cool in this heat is not only a problem for humans, but also for animals. But this is just one of the challenges they face. The city is a completely new environment that they must be able to adapt to. Cities can therefore be seen as \"living laboratories\" where evolution takes place in real time! In the SPIDER-CITY project we want to investigate how spiders can adapt to city life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe focus on two important spider traits: colour and webs. \\r\\nSpider colour. Much like a white car heats up less in the sun compared to a black car, so does a lighter spider heat up less compared to a dark spider. Therefore we expect city spiders to evolve a more lighter colour as this protects them from overheating in an already hot city. \\r\\nSpider webs. As the main tool for prey capture, webs are crucial for spider survival. Due to a lower supply of prey in cities, we expect to see webs with a smaller mesh size that are more efficient in capturing prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow?  \\r\\nCitizen scientists are a crucial part of the SPIN-CITY project! Using the SPIDERSPOTTER app you can take spider photos and report specific observations. You can analyze your own photos and those of others on the SPINNENSPOTTER website to determine spider color, length and web size. An interactive map ensures that our results are accessible to everyone who is interested!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy study adaptations to city living in spiders?\\r\\nNot only do we get crucial information about how animals can adapt to climate change, studying spiders can also be very useful for us humans! We can use spider color as a natural thermometer and thus better determine how quickly our environment heats up. And who knows, by examining in detail how a spider uses color to stay cool, we might even find new ways of staying cool in the city ourselves!\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more about SPIDERSPOTTER and the SPIDER-CITY project on www.spiderspotter.com!\\r\\n',\n",

This citizen science project allows any citizen to insert photographic records of species, as well as tracks and traces, from any location, as well as view all records of biodiversity observations made by users who access this platform. Complying with the principles of citizen science, it is intended to clearly and objectively expose the results on biological diversity to everyone who is interested.',\n",
       "  'description': \"In this citizen science project, citizens are invited to contribute to increasing knowledge of biodiversity. For this, users enter the observations of living beings on the BioRegisto platform, which they find obligatory to introduce at least one photo of the specimen, the location, the date and the time of observation. Whenever possible, the user also enters the name of the species, the quantity, the habitat, the stage of development, the sex of the individual and the activity. After the introduction of the observation, it is inserted in the internal database of the platform for species validation (if it is not possible to validate at the species level, the validation is carried out to the lowest possible taxonomic level). All observations, and respective observers, are available for consultation on the project's website (http://www.cmia-viana-castelo.pt/bioregisto) or BioRegisto App. All other data, including the most sensitive, such as the exact location of the specimen, are available in the internal database for scientific consultation and treatment, and have even been made available to some research groups in the field of biology. It is a set of metadata that can provide important data about the distribution and abundance of species using all the benefits that citizen science is capable of providing, contributing to the advancement of scientific knowledge. It should also be noted that many of the images of species already validated on the platform are, with due authorization from the user, used in actions of environmental education and dissemination of biological heritage. So far, the BioRegisto platform has a total of 249 registered species, 701 validated observations and 42 users.\",\n",

The projects was launched the first time in 2016 when the Dieselgate scandal was starting and it had the aim of informing the citizens about the illegal emissions and concentrations of NOx coming out from diesel cars and thus strenghtening the pathway towards changing mobility patterns and the creation of LEZ in Italian cities. Involvement of citizens created the capacity to spread the issue and the data utcoming from the citizens science campaigns that have gone by since 2017 in many Italian cities, not only as a result of the organization of Citizens for Air, but also, as a result of the effort by Citizens for air to share the model of the project and bases to replicate it, in many more communities and cities which were eager to organize it by themselves.  \",\n",

The tubes are therefore exposed for a month/ 4 weeks and then returned by the citizens to the coordinator which takes care of shipping them to the lab. After the lab returns the data thus including the NO2 concentrations measured in each location chosen by the citizens, a map is created to share the data after the relevant analysis and elaboration has taken place by experts to calibrate the tubes results with the local EPA monitoring stations where tubes had also monitored during the campaign. The project is now at its 3rd edition in 2020 and has monitored 3 times Milano, twice Rome, once Brescia, once Naples and has achieved that also communities and other Ngos have activated the project in Torino, Bologna, Messina and additional smaller towns: All maps and reports can be found on the home page of the NGO website https://www.cittadiniperlaria.org/# under NO2 NO Grazie',\n",

In this project we investigate, which animals are killed on roads and which factors are influencing roadkills. Your data allows us to identify roadkill hotspots. Our vision is to mitigate those hotspots in cooperation with local authorities.\\r\\nWhat does roadkill mean?\\r\\n\\r\\nRoadkills are all animals killed on roads. In most countries, official data on roadkills are only available for huntable wildlife. In the year 2012, amongst others 24852 European hare, 36865 Roe deer, 1414 European badgers were killed on roads in Austria. However, there are no data available on the effects of roads on non-huntable wildlife or red list species such as European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) or European green toad (Bufo viridis).\\r\\nWhy is roadkill important?\\r\\n\\r\\nHabitat fragmentation by roads has a severe impact on many animal species, particularly for those with high mobility or seasonal migration behaviour, such as mammals or amphibians. As a consequence, roadkill is one of the main reasons for the decrease of populations of several animal groups. Compared to a human flat, habitat fragmentation is like a road right in your corridor, seperating your living room from your kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals cross roads when foraging, in mating season (like deer, which cover long distances in search for a mating partner in autumn) or changing from winter to summer habitat (like amphibians). Species which migrate over long distances are especially affected by roadkill.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumans are also affected by roadkill. For drivers animals on roads are a great danger and most people are stressed because of the ethical burden when killing an animal. Not only accidents with big animals like deer or wild boar are causing damages to persons and/or property, also small animals like hedgehogs or toads can lead to damage because of evasion or breaking maneuvers.',\n",

Scientific studies have shown unexpected and worrying effects on the biology of many organisms as well as on whole ecosystems, but also on human health. The problems of artificial light are commonly referred to as light pollution.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Star-Spotting Experiment, thousands of pupils, members of outdoor associations, other clubs and members of the public in Sweden, UK, Ireland and Spain contributed to scientific research about light pollution by counting stars in the sky, while discovering the level of light pollution in their own neighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nParticipants used a cardboard tube (e.g. a kitchen paper roll), a bit of string, tape and a protractor to construct a measuring tube. They then observed the night sky through the tube and counted visible stars in a number of directions. Directions were determined by means of a compass, and all results were reported via a smartphone app. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe project was run as part of ForskarFredag – the Swedish events during the European Researchers' Night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Star-Spotting Experiment was created by the non-profit organisation VA (Public & Science), the National Resource Center for Physics Education (NRCF), Lund University, Kristianstad University, the Swedish National Space Agency, and the two science centres House of Science (Vetenskapens hus) and Umevatoriet, Sweden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project was run in collaboration with Fundación Descubre, Esciencia, La Palma Centre and Fundación madri+d in Spain, University College Cork and Trinity College in Ireland and Natural History Museum in London, UK.\",\n",

The objective of Foldit is to fold the structures of selected proteins as perfectly as possible, using tools provided in the game. The highest scoring solutions are analyzed by researchers, who determine whether or not there is a native structural configuration (native state) that can be applied to relevant proteins in the real world. Scientists can then use these solutions to target and eradicate diseases and create biological innovations.

Songs, poems, pictures and stories show the fascination and love that people have for the nightingales. But how much do scientists actually know about these little migrant birds?</p><p><br></p><p>Citizen Science</p><p>A group of scientists at the Museum of Natural History Berlin (MfN) are calling on the help of the public to become citizen scientists and record the nightingales’ songs with their smart phones using the Naturblick app (developed by the MfN). These snippets of song are then downloaded onto the Nightingale website map (Berlin 2018, Germany wide 2019) for all to hear and analyse. The recordings and other information collected by the citizen scientists are used to reveal understanding on the private lives of these little songsters.</p><p><br></p><p>Culture</p><p>There is probably no other bird that has received as much attention in literature and music as the nightingale. Certainly, this is due to its complex, often beautifully versatile singing. What does the nightingale mean to you? Have you yourself listened to its song, does it have a special place in your life? These are some of the questions we asked our citizen and received exciting answers and stories, which we have collected in our anecdotes book. In addition, we organize various events, which take place throughout the year to engage with the citizen scientists and explore the cultural perspective of the nightingale.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Citizen Science at School</p><p>Urbanisation is progressing uninterrupted worldwide. This increases the responsibility of cities for the preservation of biodiversity both outside and inside city boundaries. This is particularly true for Berlin, Germany's largest metropolis and the city with the richest diversity. A key objective of urban nature conservation is to bring the city's nature closer to its inhabitants. Children and young people in particular should be encouraged to do so by making the city's nature tangible and drawing attention to the preservation of green oases for more urban diversity in flora and fauna.</p><p>One aim of the environmental education of the project is to give students the opportunity to experience Berlin's urban nature and its scientific recording using the nightingale as an example. The nightingale is particularly suitable for this purpose, as its powerful-voiced males make it easy for beginners to determine the bird's voice. In this context, we investigated the effectiveness of Citizen Science on the interest of students in nature and environmental protection.</p>\",\n",

Asteroid Hunters (known Cazasteroides in Spanish) puts at the disposal of the citizenship a tool to collaborate in the protection of the Earth against the impact of asteroids.',\n",
       "  'description': 'Currently there is a population of 750,000 asteroids and each month about 2000 new objects are discovered. About 2% of the total number of asteroids are classified as NEAs (Near-Earth Objects) and about 10% -2000 are PHAs or potentially dangerous asteroids for the Earth, that is, asteroids with a non-zero probability of impact against our planet. The Minor Planet Center of the International Astronomical Union is the body that records the asteroid database, maintained with the observations of professional astronomers and amateurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) have developed an app that allows anyone, and in a friendly way, to help control the population of asteroids. It is a free application for mobile devices called “cazasteroides”. Being a asteroid hunter is simple, it only requires having the app installed (in its Android version, iOS or in a web browser) and visual acuity. The user sees in their mobile a sequence of images of the sky and marks those objects suspected of being asteroids – they move on the fixed background of stars. The detections are first filtered by the users themselves – through a voting system – and finally it will be a team of professional astronomers that verify the true nature of the objects detected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe application includes gamification techniques to make it more attractive to users, rewarding them with points for their actions. The project of Asteroid Hunters already has a large community of users and other large figures: the more than 6,420 users have added a total of 209,000 detections, 1,25 M votes cast, 3,700 known objects and 760 candidates, that is, there is a total of 760 objects that the MPC does not have cataloged and that for now have been approved as possible new asteroids.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final goal in the medium term is to have a worldwide network of telescopes that contribute their images and are part of this application so that, in a very fast and thanks to the collaboration of thousands of citizens, the population of dangerous objects can be controlled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The visual acuity of young people will allow us to detect weaker, and therefore smaller, asteroids than with traditional image recognition algorithms. The key is to get thousands of citizens involved in the project. It is the task of all to protect the future of our planet and hunters will be our shield against objects that come very close to the Earth\", comments Miquel Serra-Ricart, the astronomer coordinating the project.',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Virtual Observatory (VO) is an international initiative whose main goal is to ensure an efficient access and analysis of the information hosted in astronomical archives. In the framework of the Spanish Virtual Observatory we have taken advantage of the VO standards to develop a system to easily access astronomical archives and look for PHAs and  NEAs. At the moment, the public access is limited to the Sloan Digitized Sky Survey (SDSS) and the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS).\\r\\n\\r\\nPrecovery is the process of finding an object in astronomical archives generally for the purpose of calculating a more accurate orbit. Calculating the orbit of an astronomical object involves measuring its position on multiple occasions: The more widely separated these are in time, the more accurately the orbit can be calculated. Accurate determination of the orbital parameters is of fundamental importance for objects like asteroids with a non-negligible probability of impacting Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nApophis is an excellent example of how important Precovery can be. Discovered on June 19, 2004, follow-up observations indicated a small probability (up to 2.7%) that it would strike Earth in 2029. It was not until precovery images taken in March 2004 were analyzed when the possibility of an impact on Earth was eliminated.Apophis belongs to the category of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). These objects are characterized by an Earth Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance(MOID) of 0.05 astronomical units (AU) or less and an absolute magnitude (H) of 22.0 or less. This \"potential\" to make close Earth approaches does not mean a PHA will impact Earth. It only means there is a possibility for such a threat. By monitoring these PHAs and updating their orbits, we can better predict the close-approach statistics and thus their Earth-impact threat. The same approach applies for Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), objects whose orbits partly lie between 0.983 and 1.3 astronomical units.',\n",

Since some drugs in use have already been shown to be safe enough for human health, they may be available to treat patients with COVID-19 much sooner than a newly created compound and thus accelerate control of the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder this premise, the Biophym Group of the Institute of Matter Structure of the CSIC has proposed to perform simulations of the interaction of drugs used against Ebola, HIV infection, influenza or hepatitis B with the replication machinery of the genome of the SARS-Co-V virus. To do this, it will resort to computer techniques and the help of the computers of thousands of volunteers connected through Ibercivis' distributed computing platform. These operations will show if any of the molecules manages to inhibit a key protein in the multiplication of the virus called 'RNA-dependent RNA polymerase'.

However, he warns, \"looking for a compound capable of neutralizing a specific protein is like testing a huge number of keys to open a lock and, when this process is simulated by computer means, it requires great computing power.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Like a key in a lock, the effectiveness of a drug depends on how well its structure adapts to that of the area where the protein develops its activity,\" he adds. \"There are physics-chemistry-based models that can predict the efficacy of compounds using computational techniques - called in silico - before they are tested in clinical trials. But these models involve performing hundreds of thousands of calculations to measure the strength of the interaction of each of the possible associations between the drug and the protein, \"says Javier Ramos Díaz, one of the group\\'s researchers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project will have the support of the thousands of personal computers that are part of Ibercivis\\' distributed computing platform (\\'Ibercivis BOINC\\'), to which anyone who wants to collaborate can join. The operations will be divided into small packages that will be sent to each device. In this way, a computing capacity similar to that of a supercomputer will be achieved and all project activities can be carried out.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers only need to download the BOINC program, an open source application developed by the University of Berkeley, and join ‘Ibercivis BOINC’ at the time of installation. By doing so, they will be able to easily choose when and how to participate. For example, whoever does not want the computational capacity of their computer to be affected while using it, just leave the default configuration so that the program runs only during pause times, when the screen saver jumps.',\n",

Naturehood aims to enhance awareness and understanding of local wildlife and its needs by conducting research about the effectiveness of actions in helping wildlife to thrive. The project aims to build communities that value nature, and empower individuals to monitor and act for local wildlife in gardens, school grounds and community spaces, providing a thriving network of wildlife-rich green spaces that benefit people and nature. While it’s accepted that certain actions encourage wildlife to visit gardens and parks, there’s surprisingly little evidence considering how effective these actions are. There is even less evidence on the impact that taking these actions at scale have on wildlife numbers. For example, we know that installing a bird box could increase the chances of birds nesting in a garden, but how many bird boxes are needed within a neighbourhood for the local bird population to increase? By studying common garden species and monitoring the effects of actions for wildlife, Naturehood looks to fill this knowledge gap and encourage environmentally aware communities. Information gathered through surveys will help us track changes in species populations, and allow us to understand how to make gardens and other green spaces the best places they can be for wildlife.<br></p>',\n",

The consortium consists of 21 partners, who in turn act as multipliers and, through their participation in the EU-Citizen.Science project, build, strengthen or link national and/or disciplinary networks on Citizen Science. EU-Citizen.Science has engaged from the proposal stage the key actors in implementing citizen science initiatives at European level (either as project partners, third parties or project supporters), together with newcomers that will introduce citizen science practice in their respective countries, thus filling the gaps in the European map. The EU-Citizen.Science project involves 14 partners and 9 third parties, representing 14 European Member States and a variety of stakeholders ranging from universities, NGOs, local authorities, CSOs, SMEs and natural history museums. Many of the partners are already engaged in other SwafS projects related to RRI, co-creation and citizen science, as well as numerous initiatives at national or local level. We leverage the tremendous European potential in regard to capacities, skills, and know-how gained within the European projects and the varied stakeholder communities actively involved in citizen science.</p>\",\n",

This is a simplified version of the protocol from the Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS), which is a professional survey to collect data across the EU every three years. The idea behind FotoQuest Go was to see whether citizens could collect the same types of data at a lower cost and/or at a higher temporal and spatial density in such a way as to complement LUCAS surveys. FotoQuest Go also aims to spark a sense of adventure and exploration, encouraging participants to go outside and enjoy nature. Comparison of the data collected by the citizens with LUCAS surveyors has shown good correspondence, particularly for the major land cover types. In the last FotoQuest Go campaign, citizens were also asked to validate any changes in the land cover since the previous survey. FotoQuest Go has been adapted into several other applications, e.g., to collect forest parameters by FAO, to collect building information and verify changes detected by remote sensing by the French National Mapping Agency and to collect land cover data in Indonesia in the Restore+ project.',\n",

Integrating these citizen-driven in-situ data collections with established authoritative and open access data sources will help reduce costs, extend GEOSS and Copernicus capacities, and support comprehensive environmental monitoring systems. \\r\\n\\r\\nPolicy-relevant campaigns will be implemented in close collaboration with multiple stakeholders to ensure that citizen observations address user requirements and contribute to EU-wide environmental governance and decision-making. Campaigns for addressing local and regional Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) issues are planned for select areas in Austria, France, Germany, Spain, Slovenia and Serbia. Novel LandSense services will be deployed and tested in these areas to address critical LULC issues (i.e. urbanisation, agricultural land use and forest/habitat monitoring). For example, local residents in the cities of Vienna, Amsterdam and Heidelberg will help cooperatively detect and map changes in land cover and green space to address key issues of urban sprawl and land take. Such campaigns are facilitated through numerous pathways of citizen empowerment via the LandSense Engagement Platform, i.e. tools for discussion, online voting collaborative mapping, as well as events linked to public consultation and cooperative planning. In addition to creating tools for data collection, quality assurance, and interaction with the public, the project aims to drive innovation through collaboration with the private sector. LandSense will build an innovation marketplace to attract a vast community of users across numerous disciplines and sectors and boost Europe’s role in the business of ground-based monitoring.',\n",

For example, it is being researched how citizen data can help to improve predictions about the presence and expansion of these two mosquitoes in Spain. Since 2014 these data complement the work of many scientists and entomologists who study the distribution and dynamics of expansion of these invasive species, and make it possible to have valuable information for decision making. In fact, a recent study showed that the scientific quality of citizen data is very similar to traditional scientific data.\\r\\nMosquito Alert does high quality science and citizen participation complements the scientific work of many universities and experts. The project has revolutionised the current system of the tiger mosquito and the yellow fever mosquito surveillance and control with an innovative methodology which allows us to obtain massive data. Mosquito Alert involves, educates and does raise awareness among citizens to solve this global public health problem.',\n",

And the only public source of images of the earth in color since 2003 until today from the orbit. Although, the scientific use of this data is limited because of the difficulty to find the images on the NASA archive, where more than 3M images are stored with a location with a typical error of 500 km of radius. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cities at Night project use a three stage technique to tag, locate and georeference the night time images. \\r\\nThe first stage is called Dark Skies and it’s gamificed version, nightknights. This stage aims to tag the night time images to distinguish between images of cities, stars or other.\\r\\nThe second stage is called “Lost at Night” and aims to locate the images of cities.

With all this images, we want to create the first world map in color of the night. The use of citizen science is at the same time a tool to teach geography, increase awareness about the light pollution problem and a power full resource, as humans do not need to be trained to make most of the tasks required.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe applications of this night time images go from light pollution control, cancer epidemiological studies, civil safety, biodiversity protection, child development, energy studies.',\n",

The ultimate goal is to slow down virus transmission. This can primarily be achieved through behavioral changes and social distancing. Or even better: distant socializing with the help of digital media. In addition to the slowing effect the sudden change in behavior has on the spread of the disease, it also affects our professional and personal networks. By means of a survey-based collective diary project called CoKoNet (Corona Contact Network), IST Austria intends to investigate to which extent we are able to, want to or have to substitute various areas of our coexistence with digital contacts, and how this behavioral change will modify our networks beyond the acute crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project was developed by a team of scientists from IST Austria, including evolutionary biologists, data and computer scientists. With support from the general public, the change in our social interactions over time and across all ages (14+) will be documented in an ongoing digital diary. The aggregated and anonymized data will be evaluated as part of the PhD education at IST Austria and subsequently presented to the public in the frame of the IST Austria Science Communication and Education program.

       "  'aim': 'PhenoTandem harmonizes new phenology products derived from high resolution optical remote sensing (Sentinel-2) with the traditional phenological in-situ observations done by volunteers. Since current in-situ observation cannot always be perceived from space, the innovation consists in co-designing with citizen scientists a new protocol that will make in-situ observations interoperate with remote sensing products. This will burst the spatial distribution of remote sensing phenology products sensible to the effects of the climate change in nature while increasing data quality through in-situ validations.',\n",
       "  'description': 'The main goal of this project is to harmonize the remote sensing approach to vegetation phenology with the traditional citizen science phenological observations. This goal can be achieved by developing the following objectives: a) Make Citizen Science and Remote Sensing Phenology monitoring interoperable, b) Improve and encourage the capture of phenology data through Citizen Science, c) Achieve agreement on phenology protocols among multiple stakeholders, d) Increase application of high resolution high level products from remote sensing.\\r\\nMany elements needed are already in place. On one hand, Catalonia has a long tradition of phenological observations with a group of persistent enthusiasts that has been extended by the EU H2020 Ground Truth 2.0 Citizen Observatory RitmeNatura.cat. On the other hand, the team leading this project has recently stabilised the Catalan Data Cube beginning with the Sentinel-2 Level 2A as the first temporal series available. By using the later, we are going to derive products to determine the areas that are better fit for useful in-situ observations (because they present a clear phenological signal and are in an area known for presenting species easy to observe). In parallel we will generate a new observation protocol of in-situ phenology and we will request RitmeNatura.cat existing participants and new volunteers to use it in the next spring and fall observation campaign. They will be encouraged to provide observations as well as user feedback based on their experience (using a third element already developed by the group: the EU NextGEOSS NiMMbus system). The project will finalize when the results of the user feedback will be applied to improve both, the remote sensing products and the observation protocol for next year. The outcomes of the project will be transferred to the RitmaNatura.cat network for future use and to the remote sensing community as innovative services.',\n",

Overall, 22 Natura 2000 sites are involved (7 designated under Bird Directive, 13 under Habitats Directive and 2 under both the directives). \\r\\n\\r\\nMonitoring activities of protected habitat and species are carried out by volunteers with the assistance of professional staff. Volunteers are engaged for a period of 2 months, including a one-week intensive training course.\\r\\nAn expected long term result of the project is the contribution to create a standard monitoring system in Natural State Owned Reserves.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers are also asked to organize and manage dissemination events for the public in which they can use their personal skills.',\n",

       "  'description': '\"Measurements by thousands of citizen scientists in the Netherlands using their smartphones and the iSPEX add-on are delivering accurate data on dust particles in the atmosphere that add valuable information to professional measurements. The iSPEX team, led by Frans Snik of Leiden University, analyzed all measurements from three days in 2013 and combined them into unique maps of dust particles above the Netherlands. The results match and sometimes even exceed those of ground-based measurement networks and satellite instruments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iSPEX maps achieve a spatial resolution as small as 2 kilometers whereas satellite data are much courser. They also fill in blind spots of established ground-based atmospheric measurement networks. The scientific article that presents these first results of the iSPEX project is being published today in Geophysical Research Letters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iSPEX team developed a new atmospheric measurement method in the form of a low-cost add-on for smartphone cameras [1]. The iSPEX app instructs participants to scan the blue sky while the phone’s built-in camera takes pictures through the add-on. The photos record both the spectrum and the linear polarization [2,3] of the sunlight that is scattered by suspended dust particles, and thus contain information about the properties of these particles. While such properties are difficult to measure, much better knowledge on atmospheric particles is needed to understand their effects on health, climate and air traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of participants performed iSPEX measurements throughout the Netherlands on three cloud-free days in 2013. This large-scale citizen science experiment allowed the iSPEX team to verify the reliability of this new measurement method.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a rigorous quality assessment of each submitted data point, measurements recorded in specific areas within a limited amount of time are averaged to obtain sufficient accuracy. Subsequently the data are converted to Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), which is a standardized quantity related to the total amount of atmospheric particles. The iSPEX AOT data match comparable data from satellites and the AERONET ground station at Cabauw, the Netherlands. In areas with sufficiently high measurement densities, the iSPEX maps can even discern smaller details than satellite data.\"\\r\\n',\n",

The driving motivation is to catch several birds with one stone: tidying up our collections, engaging people at home with a constructive and concerted online activity, and suggesting to our audience miscellaneous information on our region, as well as potential way to make a better use of the collections after the participatory exercise.\\r\\nThis type of format is not new for the our team: since 2007 we have been working internationally on a diverse range of similar activities related to culture, environment, and open innovation, using various facilitating media. Among these, music remains our preferred one, and we have the Metalliferous Hills Jug Band, launched in 2018, representing our dedicated “division” for live performances, thematic playlists, and more music-related ideas to set the mood for our initiatives.\\r\\nStarting from activities we were, in fact, designing in the weeks before the emergency, we tuned them to the topic of geology, and triggered a brainstorming and casting exercise on March 15. This led to identify in a few days an initial set of resources: five mineral collections in Tatti, Southern Tuscany (the project home base), four chartered geologists around Italy, and an opening playlist of songs mentioning rock or stones: two in Italian and two in English.\\r\\nOn March 21 we launched the project in a public pilot phase, and we are now rolling: the collectors are gradually taking shots of their samples (around 200 photo samples as a first batch), following indications by two professional photographers who live in the village; the geologists are starting to examine the samples, and other classifiers are expressing their interest; musicians and music fans are proposing songs, either to compose playlists which are broadcast daily to our audience, or to launch actual performances related to the project.',\n",

       "  'description': 'It is an innovative project in which citizens, with a profile completely away from science, will contribute with their valuable experience and knowledge. These are the volunteer’s local growers from the Aragon region, the “Ambassadors of Seeds” and the heroes of our project. In their orchards, they are growing some traditional seedscollected years ago from their villages and preserved in the seed bank of the CITA research center. Many of the varieties are no longer cultivated, so the local experienced growers have the opportunity to recover the seeds, transmit their knowledge and collaborate in the research that will help their conservation and sustainable use.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, the educational community has also a major role in the project. The school centersare growing the traditional seeds in their own scholar orchards. Following a guide made for this purposeaccording with their educational level, the students collect the accurate data and process the information. In addition to aspects directly related to agriculture, agri-environmental educationhas been incorporated into the project, with the involvement of educators to promote attitudes and values towards the environmentand advertise about the relevanceof biodiversity conservation for the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seeds used for the project come from the CITA Vegetable Germplasm Bank, which holds a collection of more than 17.000 seed samples, mainly of Spanish landraces or farmers’ varieties. The knowledge compiled in the frame of this citizen science project, about the behavior of the varieties maintained in the seed bankin the locations where they were originally grown and prospected is a valuable information that could improve the value and utility of these agrobiodiversity.\\r\\n',\n",

Traditionally, many citizen science projects collecting data on plastic pollution focused almost exclusively on marine litter. Very little has been done or is known about the pre-marine terrestrial origins of marine litter due largely due to to its relationship with economic activity. For too long, the production of knowledge about the pre-marine terrestrial characteristics of <i>plastica pollutia</i> was held almost exclusively by the custodians of pollution.

The approach represents a new understanding of the underexplored field of Citizen Social Science and will result in the implementation of new or improved science-related policies. CoAct’s ambitious Research and Innovation activities will respond to issues related to Mental Health Care, Youth Employment, Environmental Justice and Gender Equality in Barcelona, Vienna, Berlin, Buenos Aires and in European Eastern countries. CoAct will define and develop a general framework for Citizen Social Science as a participatory research co-designed and directly driven by citizen groups sharing a social concern. The methodological framework will be first incubated in a consortium with Research Organizations, NGOs and global networks of Open Science and Open Data activism. Expertises from Computational Social Science, Participatory Action Research, Citizen Science evaluation or Citizen-generated Data will be incorporated to conceive a transdisciplinary Citizen Social Science that place vulnerable citizens at the center of Research and Innovation cycles, as co-designers and co-researchers. Secondly, three mission-oriented Actions and at least three Research Pilots will be led by vulnerable citizen groups with the support of Knowledge Coalitions formed by public bodies, CSOs and social innovators. The common effort will harness novel, simultaneously global and local, socially robust knowledge and scientifically reasoned measures to promote social change. An Open Citizen Science toolkit, Open Source digital platforms, and Capacity Building activities to improve data and science literacy, including a PhD Summer School, will be delivered. To demonstrate the scientific relevance and the social impact of CoAct!, a dynamic co-evaluation process with new tools will be done and shared with the broad Citizen Science community.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The project delivered the demonstration and validation of six scaled up citizen observatories in real operational conditions, both in the EU and in Africa. This was done using the innovative approach of combining the social dimensions of citizen observatories with enabling technologies, so that the implementation of the respective citizen observatories in six Demo Cases was tailored to their envisaged societal and economic benefits. The demonstration cases (4 EU and 2 African) covered the full 'spectrum’ of citizen-sensed data usage and citizen engagement, and therefore allowed testing and validating of the concept and technologies, and evaluation of their impacts under a range of conditions. The observatories focused on environmental indicators in urban and rural areas (e.g. water quality and quantity, air quality, phenology, biodiversity, heat, human-wild life incidents) related to spatial planning issues as well as land and natural resources management. The combination of demonstration cases as well as the technologies, skills and networks of citizen associations involved via the GT2.0 consortium (a good mix of Industry, SME, NGO, Government, Research and Academia) presented a unique opportunity for positioning the European industry for the roll out and uptake of related technologies and services in the EU, in Africa as well as globally. Ground Truth 2.0 coordinated and interacted with other relevant initiatives, such as GEOSS and INSPIRE as well as the sister projects funded under the same call (namely GROW, SCENT and LANDSENSE) to create mutual synergies.\",\n",

In this new project, we expand the framework to three new cities in northern Spain: Oviedo, Pamplona and Pontevedra. The following institutions are involved: the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid (CSIC), the Spanish Biodiversity Information Node (GBIF.ES), the University of Vigo, the University of Oviedo, the University of Navarra, the Terrabiota association of Pamplona, the University of Barcelona and the Institute of Marine Sciences (CSIC).\\r\\nAir pollution is one of the major problems facing big and medium city inhabitants. The burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, heating systems and industry generates numerous contaminating compounds - especially nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter - which suppose a serious problem for human health. It has been demonstrated that, in high concentrations, these compounds generate multiple respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and they are responsible for around 800,000 deaths per year in Europe.\\r\\nThe grounds of this project are based on the role of lichen species as bioindicators of different levels of air pollution. Lichens are complex symbiotic organisms formed by the union of a fungus and at least one photosynthetic partner, green algae and/or cyanobacteria. Lichens have been used for decades as bioindicators of anthropic disturbances, especially air pollution. Sensibility to disturbances vary among species, though, and it is possible to identify species with a range of preferences regarding levels of certain pollutants. Overall, it is generally accepted that the greater the diversity of lichens, the better the air quality. \\r\\nLiquencity·2 use nine indicator species growing on trees in each city, which reflect three different levels of tolerance to air pollution. To map species distribution, and therefore air quality history distribution, the project involves the educative communities (teacher training centers, teachers, students mainly from high schools) and other agents in local communities (associations, independent citizens). Using the information provided in our web site (www.liquencity2.org) and the new app for mobile devices, participants can record the observations and take pictures of them, in order to be corroborated by a team of lichen experts. Didactic resources available from the Liquencity·2 webpage allow to work at the classroom topics regarding natural science, air pollution, bioindicator organisms, and lichen biology, enhancing and contributing to the scientific and environmental education of students \\r\\nInformation gathered in all three cities will help scientists to build detailed maps of air pollution that will be transferred to local stakeholders, schools and NGOs.  Moreover, the lichen observations will be freely available at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).\\r\\n',\n",

This project is based on the sampling work of volunteer citizens of different knowledge and origin. Each participant has a to go to its plot once a month among february and june in order to identify night predatory birds´ species. In this case, they note down all the species that they hear during 15 minutes: 5 minutes in silence, 5 minutes with a decoy and 5 minutes in silence. The decoy is different depending on the month: february-tawny owl, march-long-eared owl, april-barn owl, may-eurasian scops owl, june-little owl. Then, the results obtained in that samplings have to be uploaded to the online platform Ornitho. Finally, the results of all participants are analyzed by the expert coordinador to get an annual memory of the night predatory birds of Vitoria-Gasteiz and receive conclusions about the conservation of the biodiversity.\\r\\n',\n",

The greylag goose is long-term socially monogamous whereas the endangered northern bald ibis is seasonal monogamous. Both avian model species are free-flying and habituated to the close presence of humans. The birds of the KLF are individually marked with leg rings and the social behaviour of the flock of greylag geese and the colony of northern bald ibis has been monitored over decades. In this project we investigate which behavioural patterns contribute to reproductive success. For this purpose, we equipped a number of breeding facilities with video-cameras that record the behaviour of the breeding birds. In geese, the breeding huts are located on water; for the northern bald ibises the camera is installed in nest-niches in a free flight aviary.\\r\\nBecause of the large amount of data collected at the nests, we rely on the involvement of volunteers for the analysis.

       "  'aim': 'The overall aim of the PLACES project (in French: “Plateforme collaborative pour les enjeux sociétaux”) is to propose answers to the current impasses in science communication, presently based on a strict division of work between producers and popularisers of academic knowledge. Such an organization shows nowadays two main limitations: (1) the slow process of mediatization of academic knowledge, and (2) perceived low impact of such knowledge for society, especially for disciplines in the fields of the social sciences and the humanities (SSH). The importance of the current phenomenon of massive disinformation in democratic societies can be seen as a direct consequence of this problem of the organization of scientific communication.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo explore a new model for science communication, the PLACES project proposes to bring together practitioners from the two professional worlds of journalism and SSH research, from the very beginning of knowledge production, in order to make them both co-actors of the overall process. The aim is to break down the silos of research practices, by creating the conditions for a dialogue on the modalities of science production (as opposed to vertical communication characterizing the dissemination mode). From this point of view, the project aims to put into practice collaborations following the model of \"Extreme Citizen Science\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTo do so, the PLACES project supports three experimental collaborative researches, each bringing together a SSH researcher and a journalist, with the aim of highlighting the difficulties and obstacles encountered in this type of inter-professional collaboration. In order to synthesize and problematize what has been observed, the three experimental researches are then observed by professional researchers in order to write a research report on the subject and to make proposals for the creation of a specific platform supporting this type of collaboration.',\n",
       "  'description': 'The first goal of the PLACES project is to bring social science and humanities (SSH) researchers and journalists to work hand in hand on the same research, i.e. to define a subject of study, to explore a field and produce a common analysis, or even to shape together the final product that will be disseminated. Three experimental investigations have been engaged. The first explored the life of young people (under 50) with Alzheimer\\'s disease, producing a final podcast series broadcasted by Binge Audio. The second explored the issue of migration effects during a municipal election in a border area between France and Italy, leading to a series of three press articles on Cafébabel.com. The third investigation, explores the issue of \"false periods\" induced in women by contraceptive pills, and will be published by 20 Minutes France. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second goal of the PLACES project is to observe these collaborations between SSH researchers and journalists at work during their implementation, in order to identify the obstacles, the needs for support, and the successes of such collaborations, and the way they can provide a model for renewing the communication of research. These observations are carried out by a team of two researchers, one in language sciences and the other in anthropology. Their analyses will be published in the form of a research report.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third goal is to draft specifications for the creation of a platform supporting the close collaboration of SSH researchers and journalists involved in a joint research project. The challenge here is to provide the participants first of all with a privileged communication channel as well as a database of different resources needed, but also a toolbox for applications facilitating data sharing and, more largely, collaborative work.\\r\\n',\n",

',\n",
       "  'description': 'Elementary school and educational institutions are challenged by not adequately educating children and young people for self-knowledge and solving complex societal challenges. At the same time involving citizens and communities outside traditional research institutions as participants in research systems and professional development has been defined as a megatrend that will influence future research policy. The project Community Drive is in scope with the topic by addressing research-based education development. The project involves phases with initial theoretical and research mapping of the field Citizen Science and Community driven science as well as phases with concrete development and interventions on schools in vulnerable districts in Copenhagen. The project address three overall challenges: \\r\\n\\r\\nChallenge 1 addresses the need to develop student skills in solving complex problems. The need to identify key competencies of the future has been the subject of education policy debate for several years. Citizen awareness and innovation and learning skills are highlighted as key conditions of collaboration between students and actors across institutions and disciplines. In Community Drive, a range of tools will be developed based on cases involving 21st century skills and design thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nChallenge 2 addresses the development of a more open and engaged research community. Open research is, first and foremost, a research agenda that can have a greater impact on society. Although it was primarily related to scientific publishing (open access), it also encourages knowledge sharing and involvement among users. Involvement of children and young people in teaching shows great educational potential and a strong motivation for students to participate in authentic research and development processes in collaboration with professional actors. Community Drive investigates how collaboration can be based on citizens’ expertise and professionals’ skills. \\r\\n\\r\\nChallenge 3 deals with the city’s big open data and citizen involvement in urban development. The smart city and smart society are well-known concepts related to information and communication technology. The collection of information about the city’s “status” can,in collaboration with citizens, be used to optimise resources and offer citizens new and better services. Coommunity Drive focus on the many types of data obtained in a city and the way to enable citizens to collect relevant data about the city. In particular, it will examine how existing data can be represented and applied by both students and other actors. This will contribute to the development of not only smart cities, but also smart citizens. ',\n",

       "  'aim': 'In astronomy the main goal of the research is not, very often, its dissemination to the public. However, its social relevance should be one a starting point. For the public, neither the understanding of the results, nor the processes that led to them, are trivial tasks. This is even more relevant when there is a large increase in scientific production. One way to address this challenge, used by research institutes, is to produce press releases, hoping that social media will echo them. Although this formula has obvious advantages, its randomness and the short-term effect, for example, leads to several limitations and tends to have limited duration and reduced impact on the public lacking awareness of astronomy. Thus, there is an urgent need to create mechanisms / strategies that quickly disseminate results of scientific innovation without discouraging, in the process, the promotion of positive attitudes towards science and the nature of science itself. However, the question is how to do this with the limited human resources and funding normally associated with outreach. To respond to these challenges CoAstro emerged: a citizen science project that aimed the idealization, implementation and evaluation of a scientific dissemination mechanism that would allow the flow of results and scientific processes between researchers and the public, through the involvement of dissemination structures (already present in research institutes) and non-scientific participants (teachers).',\n",
       "  'description': \"The high scientific production in astronomy impel us to find new ways to carry out scientific dissemination of content, but also, of processes. Thus, we can promote positive attitudes towards science and the public can more easily deal with bad science, scientific fraud and fake news. In this context CoAstro: @n Astronomy Condo emerged – a citizen science project that directly connected four astronomers, nine elementary school teachers, four science disseminators and one mediator. CoAstro´s, whose first edition lasted an academic year, scientific content and processes were appropriated and integrated by teachers in school initiatives, reaching approximately one thousand people.\\r\\nTeachers' involvement in astronomy research took place in two sub-projects: “Stars” and “Planets”. In the first, teachers analyzed standard stellar spectra that allow the qualitative and quantitative composition determination of 57000 stars. In addition, they determined star luminosity using Data Release 2 from the European Space Agency – ESA – GAIA Mission. In the planets project the team started with the production of a planetary transit video, through the Python program. Then, teachers analyzed curves to signal the presence of potential exoplanets. In the process, the mediator was integrated: he adapted the language and created “guidelines for research tasks”. He also ensured the maintenance of the collaborative work, articulating the challenges of research, dissemination and teaching.\\r\\nThe scientific analysis of CoAstro's results was achieved by implementing a qualitative research. The data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and observations. Results showed high improvements in teachers’ substantive and processual knowledge; positive change in epistemological attitudes and beliefs towards astronomy; as well as, the increasing of the quality of teachers’ scientific dissemination practices.\\r\\nData from astronomers and disseminators, showed one main difference: science disseminators (unlike astronomers), have not changed their perception about teachers´ professional class, due to their participation in CoAstro. Indeed, both groups agree that the project: i) was useful (and facilitated) astronomy dissemination work; ii) it was an opportunity for teachers to increase their procedural knowledge about astronomy; iii) was, at the outset, risky, because of its idea of involving teachers in real astronomy research; iv) reinforced their own perception about the importance and purposes of dissemination practices, promoting new communication skills and new ways of structuring astronomy dissemination activities.\\r\\nAlthough with some implementation difficulties (time, adequacy of tasks ...) CoAstro allowed us to understand how a citizen science project can contribute, with lasting and wide-public-ranging effects, to open the school to the surrounding community and vice-versa and how the public can open up to astronomy research and the latter to the public.\",\n",

       "  'aim': 'The fascination for the ocean and rivers together with their importance as a guarantor of species diversity know no bounds. But plastic pollution on beaches and riverbanks in Europe also doesn’t stop at man-made borders. For this reason, avoiding micro- and macroplastics in the environment, a scientific approach to this challenge and researching sustainable materials are tasks which we Europeans must take on together.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of their joint Trio-Presidency of the Council of the European Union for 2020 and 2021, Germany, Portugal and Slovenia are advocating particularly for clean seas, ocean and rivers, as well as the nature surrounding these waters. At the same time, school classes and youth groups are called upon to collect plastic waste along the banks of rivers and streams, to document the various types of the plastic waste collected at different points of a section of a river and actively support research as part of this international citizen science campaign. \\r\\n\\r\\nAre you a teacher or a leader of a youth group? Have you found a suitable stretch along a river or stream? Then you can get started! Using the detailed project materials, the types of waste identified by the individual groups (e.g. cigarette butts, pieces of film or packaging) are published on a digital map, thus assisting the scientific community in gradually closing gaps in the existing research on the amount of different types of plastic waste. The fight against pollution from plastic waste, for cleaner water and for preserving natural resources for future generations in a united Europe can only be a success if we – the citizens – actively support joint political initiatives in the places we live.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlastic Pirates – Go Europe! Are you on board?\\r\\n',\n",
       "  'description': 'Water makes up nearly two-thirds of the earth’s surface, and seas and the ocean have an enormous impact on the stability of our climate. Due to their diversity, bodies of water around the globe are a unique habitat for flora and fauna. If you live inland, far from the nearest sea, you may be asking yourselves what this all has to do with you? A lot!\\r\\nIt may start with small rivers further inland that connect to other rivers, but they eventually reach the sea. Need an example? The Danube, Europe’s longest river, flows through a total of ten different countries before reaching the Black Sea after traversing some 2,850 kilometres. Unfortunately, it’s not just ships, fish and plant remains that make their way to the sea via rivers. Different types of plastic waste as well – particles hardly visible to the human eye as well as yogurt pots or entire plastic bags in equal measure – ultimately find their way to the ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe task\\r\\nIn 2020, ‘capturing’ this waste on the riverbanks and near bodies of water becomes the Europe-wide task of the Plastic Pirates. By collecting plastic waste and uploading data on the amount of waste found, you – together with your school class or extracurricular youth group – can help conduct research on the pollution of bodies of water. You will use a range of methods to understand the pollution by waste in and around the river and to record your findings. The project booklet contains specific instructions for each method. You split into sub-groups, as different groups will tackle different aspects of the study. Uniform experimental guidelines and working steps for all teams which participate ensure that, throughout Europe, the data collected is comparable and will become visible step by step on an online map.\\r\\nOn the one hand, the joint campaign of the ministries of education, science and research of the three countries is intended to raise awareness throughout Europe for the importance of rivers as common lifelines, as well as for protecting our natural resources. On the other hand, the campaign aims to emphasize the importance of international research collaboration. \\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

However, some have escaped the controlled environment of gardens, and a small minority of these are threatening native biodiversity or are causing severe problems for infrastructure, agriculture or forestry. Well known examples include Japanese Knotweed (Reynoutria japonica), Rhododendron ponticum and Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera).\\r\\nThe period between introduction of a species and it first being noticed as a problem can be a long one, making future control problematic. In Britain on average, this time span has been more than one hundred years. Early detection of potentially problematic plants for further risk assessment could greatly improve our ability to prevent plant species becoming invasive.\\r\\nPlant Alert is based upon the assumption that it is gardeners who are most likely to notice first if a particular ornamental plant may have the potential to spread outside the garden. (Most gardeners will know which plants tend to overgrow others or tend to spread all over the garden.) This knowledge could be invaluable in identifying potential invaders, triggering timely risk assessment.\\r\\n',\n",

For example, understanding how the adaptation process occurs can help explain how viruses infect new hosts or how bacteria can resist the effects of certain antibiotics; as well as how some cells can adapt and resist chemotherapy treatments, and how pests can adapt and develop resistance to certain insecticides. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstanding the genetic basis of adaptation can provide us with relevant insight into areas of high economic and social impact, such as medicine, health, agriculture, and climate change. A greater understanding of each of these issues brings enormous potential for achieving greater social well-being.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand how organisms adapt to the environment, we must first identify what is changing within the organism and how it is changing. In biological terms, this means identifying which genes are involved in the process of change, and what molecular mechanisms they are acting through.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo do this, it is necessary to analyze organisms that both live in, and are exposed to, different environmental conditions, sequencing their genomes, and identifying changes or mutations. A suitable organism to carry out these types of genetic studies is a fruit fly that goes by the scientific name, Drosophila.\\r\\n',\n",

(#MelanogasterCTF), and its international implementation, aDaptNAtion, provides a unique opportunity for people to experience science from the front line, learn about the ins and outs of a leading frontier research project in Europe, and a chance to collaborate in its development.\\r\\n\\r\\n#MelanogasterCTF is the first European citizen science network on adaptation genomics*. It offers the possibility of experiencing scientific work by leading researchers in this field of biology, such as Dr. Josefa González and her team: the Laboratory of Evolutionary and Functional Genomics (González Lab) of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC-UPF) at Barcelona. The project is co-led by the science dissemination platform La Ciència Al Teu Món (‘Science in Your World’, LCATM).\\r\\n\\r\\n#MelanogasterCTF offers its participants the opportunity to interact with DrosEU, a pioneering international network of more than 60 high-level laboratories, in more than 20 countries from the European Union and the rest of the world. The work of the DrosEU network, in collaboration with the #MelanogasterCTF project, has already provided us with some interesting results, such as the discovery of the “Tomelloso virus”, which infects Drosophila melanogaster; or the creation of the first European map of the genetic variation found in Drosophila melanogaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough direct citizen involvement, #MelanogasterCTF brings science closer to students and teachers from both rural and other areas in both Spain and Europe; while contributing to the advancement of frontier science at the international level. The main objective of this scientific project is to understand how organisms adapt to the environment. To achieve this, we work with a genetic model organism: fruit flies from the genus Drosophila. You can read more about them in the Scientific aim and Why the fruit fly sections.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor students and teachers, #MelanogasterCTF provides an opportunity to increase their scientific, technological, and 4C capacities (collaboration, communication, creativity, critical thinking), through a hands-on project that empowers them as agents and enablers of a necessary global change. In turn, it is a synergistic project, which facilitates, accelerates, and economizes scientific research. \\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

       "  'description': 'On June 27, 2019, a landmark court decision was released in Texas, in which a judge found the petrochemical company Formosa Plastics Corporation, liable for violating the Clean Water Act because of plastic discharge into local waters. The case was brought by a civic group based in part on citizen sensed-evidence which involved volunteer observations performed over years. This practice entailing grassroots-driven environmental monitoring could be qualified as ‘Citizen Science’ and, more specifically, ‘Citizen Sensing’. The contamination could not be proved through existing data held by competent authorities since the company never filed any record of pollution with the competent authority. Rather, the monitoring and data collection was almost entirely conducted by local residents.\\r\\nCases such as the Formosa litigation are expected to increase drastically. They pose urgent research questions. Above all, the case motivates an investigation of the potential of introducing Citizen Sensing as a source of evidence in litigation over environmental wrongdoings. Furthermore, Citizen Sensing may also play a role in avoiding the court stage, as a tool to mediate the environmental conflict and to steer the responsible company to adopt an environmentally-compliant behaviour.\\r\\nRelated research is still in its infancy. The few championing actors in the debate are located in the U.S., not flanked by a parallel inquiry from the European perspective. The key objective of the Sensing for Justice project is to fill this knowledge gap in order to avoid a possible scientific and legislative vacuum, and provide newly required research capacity in the EU.\\r\\nThe research will be hosted by the European Commission Joint Research Centre, currently leading actor in the research on Citizen Science for environmental monitoring and reporting, which will allow me to play a crucial role in the enactment of measures to release Citizen Science for litigation and mediation’s potential across the EU.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Can more –\\xa0and better –\\xa0information result in less food being wasted? Researchers will be investigating this together with pupils and teachers across the whole of Sweden in the Food Waste Experiment (Svinnkollen). To assist them, they will be using an artificial intelligence (AI) app and the world’s largest food sustainability database.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur food is responsible for over one-third of human-caused climate emissions. At the same time, almost one-third of food produced globally is thrown away. In the Food Waste Experiment, researchers will be developing and testing a new way to reduce food waste in Swedish schools: by providing more information and individual feedback. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the three weeks of the Food Waste Experiment, teachers and pupils will both help develop, and use, an app to find out how much food they are throwing away. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first week, teachers and pupils will train the AI to identify many different kinds of food. Here they will photograph their lunch plates and tell the AI what kinds of food are on the plates. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe two following weeks, they will use the app to photograph their plates before and after eating, which will allow the app to calculate how much food is being wasted. Before lunch, they receive information about the day’s menu being served in the school dining hall, the nutritional content of the various dishes and their climate footprint. The information comes from the world’s largest database on factors relating to food and environmental impact, health and justice, developed by the company Consupedia in collaboration with researchers at Dalarna University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the project, researchers want to test whether it is possible to create virtuous circles in how food is dealt with – from wholesalers through to pupils. Making pupils more aware of how their food is affecting the climate, health and the environment, can lead to more thoughtful choices in the dining hall. As school kitchens get better information about what food the pupils like and dislike, menus can be adapted to better suit the needs of the pupils. The kitchens can then make more tailored orders from the wholesalers, so that the amount of waste is reduced both in school kitchens and at wholesalers.',\n",

A Business Intelligence (BI) platform, i.e. a web data-driven decision support system, will allow the integration, analysis, and synthesis of the information derived from these different types of data.\\r\\nRegarding the citizen science approach, the project has recently developed a free and open source cross-platform mobile App (SIMILE-Lakes Monitoring), where volunteers are asked to upload georeferenced photographs and eventually descriptive tags and measurements related to lakes quality (e.g. presence of algae, foams, litters or measures of transparency, temperature, pH). It also works as a collector of public events related to lake preservation (mapathons, clean-ups), as direct way of communication between authorities and citizens and as an educational tool to increase citizens' awareness on lake ecosystem.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'FLOODUP is a citizen science project to improve knowledge about the impact of floods. It has been promoted by GAMA team of University of Barcelona and developed within the framework of AQUELOO (Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology, FECYT-Ministry of Science and Innovation (FCT-18 -13408), PIRAGUA (Interreg POCTEFA-EFA210/16) and AGORA (ACA210/18/00009) projects, promoted by the University of Barcelona and with the collaboration of different institutions. The project aims to collect observations of the impacts of natural hazards, such as floods, good practices of adaptation and bad practices or vulnerable zones. To facilitate participation, an application has been developed for mobile devices (Android and IOS) in Spanish, French, Catalan and English (soon also in Basque). Contributing to the project is very simple and fast and is available to anyone who has a mobile device always with caution and without putting themselves at risk when taking the photograph. Registered users can upload observations using a short form. This form includes issues related to observations, their relationship to climate change, and the acceptability of adaptation measures. The observations, once uploaded by the user, are validated by the project team. Uploaded observations can be consulted on the project map. Educational resources can also be consulted in the App. The project is complemented with participatory workshops and educational activities. The information collected is used in the research works carried out by the group like as a reconstruction of past events. Through surveys and focus groups, the perception and level of resilience of the communities is analyzed.',\n",

       "  'aim': 'The aim of the project \"Paddle surfing for Science\" is to investigate quantities, properties, behavior and distribution of microplastics in the nearshore at the same time that promoting public understanding of science, overcoming costly research sampling of the nearshore, and raising awareness on plastic pollution in the marine environment.',\n",
       "  'description': 'Research on microplastics has rapidly expanded in recent years and has led to the discovery of vast amounts of microplastics floating offshore in all main oceanic gyres and including the Mediterranean Sea. However, there is a lack of information from a few meters from the coastline where the largest plastic mass flux is suspected to occur. The reason behind is the general use of manta trawls towed by boats or research vessels to obtain samples, which hinders nearshore sampling. We have designed a manta trawl to collect samples in the near-shore from any type of recreational sports floating gear like kayaks, sailboats, rowing boats, windsurf boards and others. Data generated is comparable to that obtained with traditional scientific equipment towed from boats. During one year, starting from October 2020, 10 social, environmental or sports associations along the NW Mediterranean coast will be acquiring scientific samples in the nearshore within the frame of two citizen science monitoring projects lead by the Spanish delegation of the non-governmental organization Surfrider Foundation Europe and the University of Barcelona. The projects “Paddle Surfing for Science” and “PlastiPlancton BCN” represent a paradigm shift in microplastic research, allowing to fill the gap in knowledge of this transition coastal area, and actively involving citizens in the generation of new monitoring data.

      "Desde 2005, mais de 24 000 voluntários participaram no Gripenet, a quem se deve o sucesso deste projecto de Ciência Cidadã. Desenvolvido por investigadores do Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, o Gripenet passou a ser coordenado pelo Instituto Nacional de Saúde Doutor Ricardo Jorge em 2015. \r\n",
      "Durante o seu decurso, o Gripenet foi co-fundador da rede europeia Influenzanet, que conta com dez países participantes. Sistemas semelhantes de monitorização participativa da gripe através da internet foram posteriormente adoptados no México, Estados Unidos, e Austrália, evidenciando a importância destes sistemas para a monitorização da saúde pública ao nível nacional e internacional.\r\n",
      "Obrigado a todos os participantes!\n",
      "A ideia de monitorizar a epidemia sazonal de gripe, utilizando a Internet e com base na participação voluntária dos cidadãos, nasceu na Holanda, em 2003. Rapidamente constituiu-se num caso de sucesso de comunicação de ciência e de promoção da saúde. O projecto holandês, entretanto alargado à Bélgica que fala flamengo, motivou investigadores do Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) a encetar uma colaboração internacional que veio dar lugar, em 2005, ao Gripenet português.\r\n",
      "Acompanhando a  actividade esperada da gripe, o Gripenet recolhe dados de Novembro a Abril. É com base nesses dados, recolhidos em questionários on-line, que é feita a monitorização da epidemia sazonal. Contudo, o site www.gripenet.pt, que serve de suporte ao projecto, está activo durante todo o ano de forma a fornecer informação sobre a doença e as temáticas com ela envolvidas. O site do Gripenet é o maior repositório de conteúdos on-line em língua portuguesa sobre a gripe.\r\n",
      "Todos podem participar na monitorização Gripenet. Basta residirem em território nacional e possuir endereço de correio electrónico. Depois de se registarem no site, os participantes recebem semanalmente uma newsletter com curiosidades e notícias sobre a gripe e são convidados a preencher, em alguns segundos, um pequeno questionário sobre os sintomas gripais (ou ausência deles) da semana anterior. A recolha de dados tem por objectivo monitorizar, em tempo real, a evolução da epidemia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Desta forma, qualquer cidadão pode contribuir com informação pertinente para o desenvolvimento de modelos epidemiológicos sobre a gripe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Esta informação não concorre com a que é obtida pelos métodos de vigilância das entidades de saúde, a cargo do Instituto Nacional de Saúde Dr. Ricardo Jorge. Tratam-se de metodologias e amostras diferentes, susceptíveis, isso sim, de se complementarem, para um melhor retrato da gripe em Portugal.

      "The Sidewalk Plants (EN) / Stoepplanten (NL) citizen science project strives to increase interest for urban plants and plants in general through monitoring the effect of anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors on urban sidewalk plant species communities. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The plants in our environment are often overlooked and underappreciated. This plant blindness can be explained by a lack of interest in and focus on plant science in education in favour of animals. However, most life on earth, including humans, depend mainly on plants for food and shelter. Consequently, it is important for society to acknowledge the importance of plants and combat plant blindness. City sidewalk plant communities survive despite the extreme stress factors of urban environments, for instance, drought, access to little soil, high levels of manual disturbance and herbicides. Therefore, these plants are highly adaptable and could show how plants change and survive in extreme environments. Previous studies in urban ecology have shown that plant species richness, and anthropogenic factors can best explain biodiversity. These factors and their role in plant species composition, richness and diversity needs further study to infer which species or species communities are highly successful in these challenging urban environments. To understand the ecology of urban plant communities could help us design sustainable and biodiverse green cities in the future.\n",
      "The Sidewalk Plants ((EN) / Stoepplanten (NL) citizen science project involves citizens monitoring plant species growing around their home, neighborhood or town as a whole. The goals is to find out what plant communities are most succesful, what biodiversity hotspots exist within the urban ecosystem and how their location can be explained by anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors. We believe this will generate new knowledge and understanding of plants in citizens and for science. \r\n",
      "The project will be easy to participate in and as inclusive as possible. Participants of all ages are welcome to participate only once or many times and potentially become part of the on- and offline Stoepplanten citizen science community. During this project we want all the monitoring data to be open access and available for citizens to play with. We want to encourage citizens to come up with their own research questions and coach or enable them to work with the data to potentially answer these questions. \r\n",
      "We also aim for citizens to become more engaged with their direct environment and observe the cities street management, research what is done and to what effect so they can be empowered to take action within their municipality. They could then write an informed petition or get politically active in any way to potentially change street management for more sustainable, biodiverse and green cities and towns.\r\n",
      "The aim is also to increase the interest for plants and combat plant blindness. The research questions therefore include the motivation, change in attitude towards plants, knowledge about plants in the participating citizen scientists. Along the development of this citizen science project we aim to organize focus groups including scientists, citizen scientists and policy makers to constantly improve our practices.\r\n",
      "This citizen science project is the key endeavor of a PhD project. Therefore, research output on both urban plant communities and citizen science will be published. Citizen scientist contributions will be acknowledged appropriately in all publications.\r\n",

      "Europe has invested a significant amount of resources in infrastructure and services in order to achieve an autonomous, accurate and comprehensive Earth observation capacity. Environmental monitoring systems, such as Copernicus Corine Land Cover, produce a variety of valuable datasets, offered for the entire EU landscape. Yet, the update rate is scarce due to increased costs and timely data validation procedures, while investing in additional in-situ equipment or in maintaining the current infrastructure is unsustainable. Citizen science constitutes an innovative approach of environmental monitoring, capable to complement the existing Earth Observation and in-situ infrastructure with up-to-date information about local ecosystems.  The majority of citizens however, both as individuals and as groups quite often feel disengaged from influencing environmental policies, whilst also remain unaware of publicly available information and initiatives. \r\n",
      "SCENT Citizen Observatory project has created a toolbox (https://scent-project.eu/scent-toolbox) of smart collaborative technologies and applications that aims to engage citizens with environmental monitoring, enabling them to become the ‘eyes’ of the policy makers and local authorities. Citizens are using low-cost equipment to collect various environmental information (land cover/use, river parameters, soil conditions), that are consolidated to improve flood modelling and are offered to the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) in an interoperable way, following common environmental standards (Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards). \n",
      "The project designed, developed and implemented a people-centric observation web, formulated on the basis of using low-cost, portable sensors and innovative applications.  The SCENT toolbox offers various capabilities involving crowdsourcing and serious gaming mechanisms towards enabling, incentivising and increasing the involvement of citizens as individuals and/or citizen groups/associations in the process of environmental monitoring. By using their smartphones and portable sensors, citizens can take images of land cover / land use while walking around in their city or the countryside, report events that may affect floods (e.g. river obstacles) and measure water level, flow velocity and soil moisture, without complex or bulky equipment. They are doing this in a playful manner, through a game of ‘catching’ animated animals in their surroundings and collecting points. \r\n",
      "On top of that, novel frameworks are employed to ensure the management, quality control and interoperability of citizen-generated data, coupled with machine learning frameworks that extract valuable information from the collected resources and thus lead to better use of available data, repositories and in-situ monitoring systems. Last but not least, apart from extending the in-situ infrastructure with citizen-sourced observations, the use of the latter was demonstrated in the context of creating flood models and land cove / use maps of enhanced characteristics that can improve decision making.  \r\n",
      "Additionally, the value of the SCENT toolbox was demonstrated in two regions in real but diverse examples where flood monitoring is of great importance. The first region is the wetland of Danube Delta in Romania, where flooding is a necessary and beneficial part of maintaining the ecosystem, and the second is the Kifisos River basin around the urban landscape of Athens in Greece, where flooding is a major problem for the local communities.\r\n",
      "Various citizen-science campaigns (10 in total) were conducted during 2018 & 2019 in these regions. These field campaigns were organised in different periods in both pilots covering in total 11 months, while focusing on themes of interest to the local communities and the policy makers such as the collection of LC/LU elements, river parameters and soil measurements. The objective of the campaigns was to collect valuable environmental information, at frequent time intervals, that could be further analysed and used. \r\n",
      "More than 700 volunteers participated in the field campaigns, testing, evaluating and validating the SCENT toolbox, while also contributing with a significant amount of 24200+ environmental resources in both pilot areas. It should be noted, that SCENT has at the same time established an active online community, involving, as of August 2019, 1130+ active registered users of its public facing applications (SCENT Explore, SCENT Collaborate, SCENT Measure, https://scent-project.eu/scent-toolbox). \n",

      "<p>For over 40 years, the RSPB has asked the public to count the birds in their garden. With over half a million people now regularly taking part, coupled with 40 years worth of data, Big Garden Birdwatch allows us to monitor trends and helps us understand how birds are doing. As the format of the survey has stayed the same, the scientific data can be compared year-on-year, making your results very valuable to our scientists. With results from so many gardens, we are able to create a \"snapshot\" of bird numbers across the UK. For four decades, the Big Garden Birdwatch has highlighted the winners and losers in the garden bird world. It was one of the first surveys to alert the RSPB to the decline in the number of song thrushes in gardens. This species was a firm fixture in the top 10 in 1979, but by 2019 numbers of song thrushes seen in gardens had declined by 76%, coming in at number 20. Your results help us spot problems, but more importantly, they are also the first step in putting things right. This is why it's so important that we count garden birds.<br></p>\n",

(Mediterranean Elasmobranchs Citizen Observations) project.\n",
      "Sharks and rays have been present on earth for nearly half a billion years, with more than 1,250 extant species. The pivotal importance of cartilaginous fish for marine ecosystems is highlighted by the fact that most shark and some ray species constitute top predators, thus possess central and stabilizing functions in marine food webs. Based on the latest report of IUCN at least half of the rays (50%, 16 of 32 species) in the Mediterranean Sea face an elevated risk of extinction, as well as 54% of sharks (22 of 41). The principal driver for this is overfishing along with the life history characteristics of these species (low reproductive, slow growth rates and long life spans). In Greek Seas at least 67 species of cartilaginous fish are present but existing knowledge on their distribution, ecology and biology is still limited. In Cyprus, studies related to the presence/biology of cartilaginous fish are limited and deficient. Around 30 species of cartilaginous fish have been reported to be present in Cypriot waters to date. \r\n",

      "Have you ever walked around the city in the summer? Then you know it can get very hot because of all the asphalt and the concrete that retains the heat! Staying cool in this heat is not only a problem for humans, but also for animals. But this is just one of the challenges they face. The city is a completely new environment that they must be able to adapt to. Cities can therefore be seen as \"living laboratories\" where evolution takes place in real time! In the SPIDER-CITY project we want to investigate how spiders can adapt to city life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We focus on two important spider traits: colour and webs. \r\n",
      "Spider colour. Much like a white car heats up less in the sun compared to a black car, so does a lighter spider heat up less compared to a dark spider. Therefore we expect city spiders to evolve a more lighter colour as this protects them from overheating in an already hot city. \r\n",

Whenever possible, the user also enters the name of the species, the quantity, the habitat, the stage of development, the sex of the individual and the activity. After the introduction of the observation, it is inserted in the internal database of the platform for species validation (if it is not possible to validate at the species level, the validation is carried out to the lowest possible taxonomic level). All observations, and respective observers, are available for consultation on the project's website (http://www.cmia-viana-castelo.pt/bioregisto) or BioRegisto App. All other data, including the most sensitive, such as the exact location of the specimen, are available in the internal database for scientific consultation and treatment, and have even been made available to some research groups in the field of biology. It is a set of metadata that can provide important data about the distribution and abundance of species using all the benefits that citizen science is capable of providing, contributing to the advancement of scientific knowledge. It should also be noted that many of the images of species already validated on the platform are, with due authorization from the user, used in actions of environmental education and dissemination of biological heritage.

The projects was launched the first time in 2016 when the Dieselgate scandal was starting and it had the aim of informing the citizens about the illegal emissions and concentrations of NOx coming out from diesel cars and thus strenghtening the pathway towards changing mobility patterns and the creation of LEZ in Italian cities. Involvement of citizens created the capacity to spread the issue and the data utcoming from the citizens science campaigns that have gone by since 2017 in many Italian cities, not only as a result of the organization of Citizens for Air, but also, as a result of the effort by Citizens for air to share the model of the project and bases to replicate it, in many more communities and cities which were eager to organize it by themselves.  \n",

The tubes are therefore exposed for a month/ 4 weeks and then returned by the citizens to the coordinator which takes care of shipping them to the lab. After the lab returns the data thus including the NO2 concentrations measured in each location chosen by the citizens, a map is created to share the data after the relevant analysis and elaboration has taken place by experts to calibrate the tubes results with the local EPA monitoring stations where tubes had also monitored during the campaign.

In this project we investigate, which animals are killed on roads and which factors are influencing roadkills. Your data allows us to identify roadkill hotspots. Our vision is to mitigate those hotspots in cooperation with local authorities.\r\n",
      "What does roadkill mean?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Roadkills are all animals killed on roads. In most countries, official data on roadkills are only available for huntable wildlife. In the year 2012, amongst others 24852 European hare, 36865 Roe deer, 1414 European badgers were killed on roads in Austria. However, there are no data available on the effects of roads on non-huntable wildlife or red list species such as European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) or European green toad (Bufo viridis).\r\n",
      "Why is roadkill important?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Habitat fragmentation by roads has a severe impact on many animal species, particularly for those with high mobility or seasonal migration behaviour, such as mammals or amphibians. As a consequence, roadkill is one of the main reasons for the decrease of populations of several animal groups. Compared to a human flat, habitat fragmentation is like a road right in your corridor, seperating your living room from your kitchen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Animals cross roads when foraging, in mating season (like deer, which cover long distances in search for a mating partner in autumn) or changing from winter to summer habitat (like amphibians). Species which migrate over long distances are especially affected by roadkill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Humans are also affected by roadkill. For drivers animals on roads are a great danger and most people are stressed because of the ethical burden when killing an animal. Not only accidents with big animals like deer or wild boar are causing damages to persons and/or property, also small animals like hedgehogs or toads can lead to damage because of evasion or breaking maneuvers.\n",

Asteroid Hunters (known Cazasteroides in Spanish) puts at the disposal of the citizenship a tool to collaborate in the protection of the Earth against the impact of asteroids.\n",
      "Currently there is a population of 750,000 asteroids and each month about 2000 new objects are discovered. About 2% of the total number of asteroids are classified as NEAs (Near-Earth Objects) and about 10% -2000 are PHAs or potentially dangerous asteroids for the Earth, that is, asteroids with a non-zero probability of impact against our planet. The Minor Planet Center of the International Astronomical Union is the body that records the asteroid database, maintained with the observations of professional astronomers and amateurs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Researchers at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) have developed an app that allows anyone, and in a friendly way, to help control the population of asteroids. It is a free application for mobile devices called “cazasteroides”. Being a asteroid hunter is simple, it only requires having the app installed (in its Android version, iOS or in a web browser) and visual acuity. The user sees in their mobile a sequence of images of the sky and marks those objects suspected of being asteroids – they move on the fixed background of stars. The detections are first filtered by the users themselves – through a voting system – and finally it will be a team of professional astronomers that verify the true nature of the objects detected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The application includes gamification techniques to make it more attractive to users, rewarding them with points for their actions. The project of Asteroid Hunters already has a large community of users and other large figures: the more than 6,420 users have added a total of 209,000 detections, 1,25 M votes cast, 3,700 known objects and 760 candidates, that is, there is a total of 760 objects that the MPC does not have cataloged and that for now have been approved as possible new asteroids.\r\n",

The key is to get thousands of citizens involved in the project.

Accurate determination of the orbital parameters is of fundamental importance for objects like asteroids with a non-negligible probability of impacting Earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Apophis is an excellent example of how important Precovery can be. Discovered on June 19, 2004, follow-up observations indicated a small probability (up to 2.7%) that it would strike Earth in 2029. It was not until precovery images taken in March 2004 were analyzed when the possibility of an impact on Earth was eliminated.Apophis belongs to the category of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). These objects are characterized by an Earth Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance(MOID) of 0.05 astronomical units (AU) or less and an absolute magnitude (H) of 22.0 or less. This \"potential\" to make close Earth approaches does not mean a PHA will impact Earth. It only means there is a possibility for such a threat. By monitoring these PHAs and updating their orbits, we can better predict the close-approach statistics and thus their Earth-impact threat. The same approach applies for Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), objects whose orbits partly lie between 0.983 and 1.3 astronomical units.\n",

      "Finding a drug used in the treatment of other viral diseases that works against coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the purpose of the COVID-PHYM citizen science project, promoted by the Higher Council for Scientific Research (CSIC) and the Foundation Ibercivis. Since some drugs in use have already been shown to be safe enough for human health, they may be available to treat patients with COVID-19 much sooner than a newly created compound and thus accelerate control of the pandemic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Under this premise, the Biophym Group of the Institute of Matter Structure of the CSIC has proposed to perform simulations of the interaction of drugs used against Ebola, HIV infection, influenza or hepatitis B with the replication machinery of the genome of the SARS-Co-V virus. To do this, it will resort to computer techniques and the help of the computers of thousands of volunteers connected through Ibercivis' distributed computing platform. These operations will show if any of the molecules manages to inhibit a key protein in the multiplication of the virus called 'RNA-dependent RNA polymerase'. If so, the drug would become an ideal candidate for testing in human clinical trials.\n",
      "\"Having effective drugs against the coronavirus is essential to reduce the severity and mortality of the disease,\" explains Javier Martínez de Salazar, leader of the Biophym group. \"The protein selected as a target plays a central role in the replication and transcription of the genetic material of the virus; If it is neutralized, it can slow down the spread of the virus in the body and aid in healing, \"he adds. However, he warns, \"looking for a compound capable of neutralizing a specific protein is like testing a huge number of keys to open a lock and, when this process is simulated by computer means, it requires great computing power.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Like a key in a lock, the effectiveness of a drug depends on how well its structure adapts to that of the area where the protein develops its activity,\" he adds. \"There are physics-chemistry-based models that can predict the efficacy of compounds using computational techniques - called in silico - before they are tested in clinical trials. But these models involve performing hundreds of thousands of calculations to measure the strength of the interaction of each of the possible associations between the drug and the protein, \"says Javier Ramos Díaz, one of the group's researchers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The project will have the support of the thousands of personal computers that are part of Ibercivis' distributed computing platform ('Ibercivis BOINC'), to which anyone who wants to collaborate can join. The operations will be divided into small packages that will be sent to each device. In this way, a computing capacity similar to that of a supercomputer will be achieved and all project activities can be carried out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Volunteers only need to download the BOINC program, an open source application developed by the University of Berkeley, and join ‘Ibercivis BOINC’ at the time of installation. By doing so, they will be able to easily choose when and how to participate. For example, whoever does not want the computational capacity of their computer to be affected while using it, just leave the default configuration so that the program runs only during pause times, when the screen saver jumps.\n",

The project aims to build communities that value nature, and empower individuals to monitor and act for local wildlife in gardens, school grounds and community spaces, providing a thriving network of wildlife-rich green spaces that benefit people and nature. While it’s accepted that certain actions encourage wildlife to visit gardens and parks, there’s surprisingly little evidence considering how effective these actions are. There is even less evidence on the impact that taking these actions at scale have on wildlife numbers. For example, we know that installing a bird box could increase the chances of birds nesting in a garden, but how many bird boxes are needed within a neighbourhood for the local bird population to increase? By studying common garden species and monitoring the effects of actions for wildlife, Naturehood looks to fill this knowledge gap and encourage environmentally aware communities. Information gathered through surveys will help us track changes in species populations, and allow us to understand how to make gardens and other green spaces the best places they can be for wildlife.<br></p>\n",

The understanding of what methods and approaches belong to citizen science, what quality criteria to apply and how to describe the added value for an innovative, creative, and sustainable Europe vary between different disciplines, sectors, and geographical regions.</p><p><br></p><p>As a 'Coordination and Support Action', the project is focused on communication, coordination, and support of activities related to citizen science. The consortium consists of 21 partners, who in turn act as multipliers and, through their participation in the EU-Citizen.Science project, build, strengthen or link national and/or disciplinary networks on Citizen Science. EU-Citizen.Science has engaged from the proposal stage the key actors in implementing citizen science initiatives at European level (either as project partners, third parties or project supporters), together with newcomers that will introduce citizen science practice in their respective countries, thus filling the gaps in the European map. The EU-Citizen.Science project involves 14 partners and 9 third parties, representing 14 European Member States and a variety of stakeholders ranging from universities, NGOs, local authorities, CSOs, SMEs and natural history museums. Many of the partners are already engaged in other SwafS projects related to RRI, co-creation and citizen science, as well as numerous initiatives at national or local level. We leverage the tremendous European potential in regard to capacities, skills, and know-how gained within the European projects and the varied stakeholder communities actively involved in citizen science.</p>\n",

      "FotoQuest Go is a mobile app for citizens to collect ground-based data at specific locations provided in the app. With many gamification elements including prizes and monetary incentives, citizens collect information on land cover and land use, taking photographs in four cardinal directions and at the location. This is a simplified version of the protocol from the Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS), which is a professional survey to collect data across the EU every three years. The idea behind FotoQuest Go was to see whether citizens could collect the same types of data at a lower cost and/or at a higher temporal and spatial density in such a way as to complement LUCAS surveys. FotoQuest Go also aims to spark a sense of adventure and exploration, encouraging participants to go outside and enjoy nature. Comparison of the data collected by the citizens with LUCAS surveyors has shown good correspondence, particularly for the major land cover types. In the last FotoQuest Go campaign, citizens were also asked to validate any changes in the land cover since the previous survey. FotoQuest Go has been adapted into several other applications, e.g., to collect forest parameters by FAO, to collect building information and verify changes detected by remote sensing by the French National Mapping Agency and to collect land cover data in Indonesia in the Restore+ project.\n",

These images can be very high-resolution satellite images, orthophotos, images from UAVs or geotagged photographs.

If the answer is yes, the volunteer swipes the image to the right, if no, to the left and if maybe, to the bottom. Picture Pile was originally called Cropland Capture and was used to collect more than 5 million assessments of cropland. As a more generic tool, it has been used to collect data on deforestation, building damage from Hurricane Matthew, cloud cover, nighttime lights, oil palm plantations and poverty assessment. \n",

      "Within the EU’s Earth Observation (EO) monitoring framework, there is a need for low-cost methods for acquiring high quality in-situ data to create accurate and well-validated environmental monitoring products. The aim of the LandSense project is to build a far-reaching Citizen Observatory for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) monitoring that will also function as a technology innovation marketplace. LandSense deploys advanced tools, services and resources to mobilise and engage citizens to collect in-situ observations (i.e. ground-based data and visual interpretations of EO imagery). Integrating these citizen-driven in-situ data collections with established authoritative and open access data sources will help reduce costs, extend GEOSS and Copernicus capacities, and support comprehensive environmental monitoring systems.\n",
      "LandSense builds an innovative Citizen Observatory for Land Use & Land Cover (LULC) monitoring, by connecting citizens with satellite imagery to transform current approaches to environmental decision making. LandSense aims to uncover the collective potential of citizen science and Earth observation (EO) data to improve the way people see, map and understand the world. Citizen Observatories are community-driven mechanisms to complement existing systems for improved environmental monitoring. They are fostered through innovative and novel EO mobile applications, allowing citizens to not only play a key role in LULC monitoring, but also to be directly involved in the co-creation of such solutions. LandSense will deploy advanced tools, services and resources to mobilise and engage citizens to collect in-situ observations (i.e. ground-based data and visual interpretations of EO imagery). Integrating these citizen-driven in-situ data collections with established authoritative and open access data sources will help reduce costs, extend GEOSS and Copernicus capacities, and support comprehensive environmental monitoring systems. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Policy-relevant campaigns will be implemented in close collaboration with multiple stakeholders to ensure that citizen observations address user requirements and contribute to EU-wide environmental governance and decision-making. Campaigns for addressing local and regional Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) issues are planned for select areas in Austria, France, Germany, Spain, Slovenia and Serbia. Novel LandSense services will be deployed and tested in these areas to address critical LULC issues (i.e. urbanisation, agricultural land use and forest/habitat monitoring). For example, local residents in the cities of Vienna, Amsterdam and Heidelberg will help cooperatively detect and map changes in land cover and green space to address key issues of urban sprawl and land take. Such campaigns are facilitated through numerous pathways of citizen empowerment via the LandSense Engagement Platform, i.e. tools for discussion, online voting collaborative mapping, as well as events linked to public consultation and cooperative planning. In addition to creating tools for data collection, quality assurance, and interaction with the public, the project aims to drive innovation through collaboration with the private sector. LandSense will build an innovation marketplace to attract a vast community of users across numerous disciplines and sectors and boost Europe’s role in the business of ground-based monitoring.\n",

      "When dead plants decompose in the soil, the decomposition process emits carbon dioxide, a gas which plays an important role in global warming. In order to be able to make better predictions about future climate change, scientists need to know more about how this decomposition occurs. The Tea Bag Experiment, which involved Swedish schools, was part of the larger Teatime 4 Science initiative (http://www.teatime4science.org/), which has developed the Tea Bag Index – a simple method to study decomposition of plant materials in soil. Here, participants bury tea bags for a certain amount of time, and then dig up and weigh the tea bags to see how much plant material that has decomposed during this time. The Tea Bag Experiment was designed in collaboration with researchers at Umeå University, the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety. The experiment was coordinated in Sweden by VA (Public & Science).\n",

      "PhenoTandem harmonizes new phenology products derived from high resolution optical remote sensing (Sentinel-2) with the traditional phenological in-situ observations done by volunteers. Since current in-situ observation cannot always be perceived from space, the innovation consists in co-designing with citizen scientists a new protocol that will make in-situ observations interoperate with remote sensing products. This will burst the spatial distribution of remote sensing phenology products sensible to the effects of the climate change in nature while increasing data quality through in-situ validations.\n",
      "The main goal of this project is to harmonize the remote sensing approach to vegetation phenology with the traditional citizen science phenological observations. This goal can be achieved by developing the following objectives: a) Make Citizen Science and Remote Sensing Phenology monitoring interoperable, b) Improve and encourage the capture of phenology data through Citizen Science, c) Achieve agreement on phenology protocols among multiple stakeholders, d) Increase application of high resolution high level products from remote sensing.\r\n",
      "Many elements needed are already in place. On one hand, Catalonia has a long tradition of phenological observations with a group of persistent enthusiasts that has been extended by the EU H2020 Ground Truth 2.0 Citizen Observatory RitmeNatura.cat. On the other hand, the team leading this project has recently stabilised the Catalan Data Cube beginning with the Sentinel-2 Level 2A as the first temporal series available. By using the later, we are going to derive products to determine the areas that are better fit for useful in-situ observations (because they present a clear phenological signal and are in an area known for presenting species easy to observe). In parallel we will generate a new observation protocol of in-situ phenology and we will request RitmeNatura.cat existing participants and new volunteers to use it in the next spring and fall observation campaign. They will be encouraged to provide observations as well as user feedback based on their experience (using a third element already developed by the group: the EU NextGEOSS NiMMbus system). The project will finalize when the results of the user feedback will be applied to improve both, the remote sensing products and the observation protocol for next year. The outcomes of the project will be transferred to the RitmaNatura.cat network for future use and to the remote sensing community as innovative services.\n",

Moreover, the project will generate important data for the management of the reserves and for the reporting under the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. The volunteers will acquire knowledge and skills on species, habitats and conservation actions in Natura 2000 sites. The specific objectives are: i) to generate a significant improvement of monitoring data for selected habitats and species in the selected study areas; ii) to make standardized biodiversity monitoring methods available to the target State Owned Reserves.\n",

CoAct will define and develop a general framework for Citizen Social Science as a participatory research co-designed and directly driven by citizen groups sharing a social concern. The methodological framework will be first incubated in a consortium with Research Organizations, NGOs and global networks of Open Science and Open Data activism. Expertises from Computational Social Science, Participatory Action Research, Citizen Science evaluation or Citizen-generated Data will be incorporated to conceive a transdisciplinary Citizen Social Science that place vulnerable citizens at the center of Research and Innovation cycles, as co-designers and co-researchers. Secondly, three mission-oriented Actions and at least three Research Pilots will be led by vulnerable citizen groups with the support of Knowledge Coalitions formed by public bodies, CSOs and social innovators. The common effort will harness novel, simultaneously global and local, socially robust knowledge and scientifically reasoned measures to promote social change. An Open Citizen Science toolkit, Open Source digital platforms, and Capacity Building activities to improve data and science literacy, including a PhD Summer School, will be delivered. To demonstrate the scientific relevance and the social impact of CoAct!, a dynamic co-evaluation process with new tools will be done and shared with the broad Citizen Science community.\n",

      "The project delivered the demonstration and validation of six scaled up citizen observatories in real operational conditions, both in the EU and in Africa. This was done using the innovative approach of combining the social dimensions of citizen observatories with enabling technologies, so that the implementation of the respective citizen observatories in six Demo Cases was tailored to their envisaged societal and economic benefits. The demonstration cases (4 EU and 2 African) covered the full 'spectrum’ of citizen-sensed data usage and citizen engagement, and therefore allowed testing and validating of the concept and technologies, and evaluation of their impacts under a range of conditions. The observatories focused on environmental indicators in urban and rural areas (e.g. water quality and quantity, air quality, phenology, biodiversity, heat, human-wild life incidents) related to spatial planning issues as well as land and natural resources management. The combination of demonstration cases as well as the technologies, skills and networks of citizen associations involved via the GT2.0 consortium (a good mix of Industry, SME, NGO, Government, Research and Academia) presented a unique opportunity for positioning the European industry for the roll out and uptake of related technologies and services in the EU, in Africa as well as globally. Ground Truth 2.0 coordinated and interacted with other relevant initiatives, such as GEOSS and INSPIRE as well as the sister projects funded under the same call (namely GROW, SCENT and LANDSENSE) to create mutual synergies.\n",

      "Liquencity·2 represents the continuation of the citizen science LiquenCity (more information at www.liquencity.org), in which more than 2,000 people participated in the cities of Madrid and Barcelona. In this new project, we expand the framework to three new cities in northern Spain: Oviedo, Pamplona and Pontevedra. The following institutions are involved: the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid (CSIC), the Spanish Biodiversity Information Node (GBIF.ES), the University of Vigo, the University of Oviedo, the University of Navarra, the Terrabiota association of Pamplona, the University of Barcelona and the Institute of Marine Sciences (CSIC).\r\n",
      "Air pollution is one of the major problems facing big and medium city inhabitants. The burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, heating systems and industry generates numerous contaminating compounds - especially nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter - which suppose a serious problem for human health. It has been demonstrated that, in high concentrations, these compounds generate multiple respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and they are responsible for around 800,000 deaths per year in Europe.\r\n",
      "The grounds of this project are based on the role of lichen species as bioindicators of different levels of air pollution. Lichens are complex symbiotic organisms formed by the union of a fungus and at least one photosynthetic partner, green algae and/or cyanobacteria. Lichens have been used for decades as bioindicators of anthropic disturbances, especially air pollution. Sensibility to disturbances vary among species, though, and it is possible to identify species with a range of preferences regarding levels of certain pollutants. Overall, it is generally accepted that the greater the diversity of lichens, the better the air quality. \r\n",
      "Liquencity·2 use nine indicator species growing on trees in each city, which reflect three different levels of tolerance to air pollution. To map species distribution, and therefore air quality history distribution, the project involves the educative communities (teacher training centers, teachers, students mainly from high schools) and other agents in local communities (associations, independent citizens). Using the information provided in our web site (www.liquencity2.org) and the new app for mobile devices, participants can record the observations and take pictures of them, in order to be corroborated by a team of lichen experts. Didactic resources available from the Liquencity·2 webpage allow to work at the classroom topics regarding natural science, air pollution, bioindicator organisms, and lichen biology, enhancing and contributing to the scientific and environmental education of students \r\n",
      "Information gathered in all three cities will help scientists to build detailed maps of air pollution that will be transferred to local stakeholders, schools and NGOs.  Moreover, the lichen observations will be freely available at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).\r\n",

Reproductive success can be calculated from the number of offspring that survive to fledge. However, the number of chicks that fledge may be different from the number of eggs that hatch. By observing the behaviour of the birds across the breeding period we aim to discover which behavioural patterns contribute to reproductive success. \r\n",

Citizen Scientists worldwide can participate via the online platform Zooniverse by watching short videos of two bird species -  greylag geese and northern bald ibis -  at their nests and helping us to find out more about their breeding behaviour. The greylag goose is long-term socially monogamous whereas the endangered northern bald ibis is seasonal monogamous. Both avian model species are free-flying and habituated to the close presence of humans. The birds of the KLF are individually marked with leg rings and the social behaviour of the flock of greylag geese and the colony of northern bald ibis has been monitored over decades. In this project we investigate which behavioural patterns contribute to reproductive success. For this purpose, we equipped a number of breeding facilities with video-cameras that record the behaviour of the breeding birds. In geese, the breeding huts are located on water; for the northern bald ibises the camera is installed in nest-niches in a free flight aviary.\r\n",
      "Because of the large amount of data collected at the nests, we rely on the involvement of volunteers for the analysis. The citizen scientists code short videos of the birds at the nest and also support the project by asking questions and suggesting improvements in the \"Talk\".\r\n",

      "The overall aim of the PLACES project (in French: “Plateforme collaborative pour les enjeux sociétaux”) is to propose answers to the current impasses in science communication, presently based on a strict division of work between producers and popularisers of academic knowledge. Such an organization shows nowadays two main limitations: (1) the slow process of mediatization of academic knowledge, and (2) perceived low impact of such knowledge for society, especially for disciplines in the fields of the social sciences and the humanities (SSH). The importance of the current phenomenon of massive disinformation in democratic societies can be seen as a direct consequence of this problem of the organization of scientific communication.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To explore a new model for science communication, the PLACES project proposes to bring together practitioners from the two professional worlds of journalism and SSH research, from the very beginning of knowledge production, in order to make them both co-actors of the overall process. The aim is to break down the silos of research practices, by creating the conditions for a dialogue on the modalities of science production (as opposed to vertical communication characterizing the dissemination mode). From this point of view, the project aims to put into practice collaborations following the model of \"Extreme Citizen Science\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To do so, the PLACES project supports three experimental collaborative researches, each bringing together a SSH researcher and a journalist, with the aim of highlighting the difficulties and obstacles encountered in this type of inter-professional collaboration. In order to synthesize and problematize what has been observed, the three experimental researches are then observed by professional researchers in order to write a research report on the subject and to make proposals for the creation of a specific platform supporting this type of collaboration.\n",
      "The first goal of the PLACES project is to bring social science and humanities (SSH) researchers and journalists to work hand in hand on the same research, i.e. to define a subject of study, to explore a field and produce a common analysis, or even to shape together the final product that will be disseminated. Three experimental investigations have been engaged. The first explored the life of young people (under 50) with Alzheimer's disease, producing a final podcast series broadcasted by Binge Audio. The second explored the issue of migration effects during a municipal election in a border area between France and Italy, leading to a series of three press articles on Cafébabel.com. The third investigation, explores the issue of \"false periods\" induced in women by contraceptive pills, and will be published by 20 Minutes France. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The second goal of the PLACES project is to observe these collaborations between SSH researchers and journalists at work during their implementation, in order to identify the obstacles, the needs for support, and the successes of such collaborations, and the way they can provide a model for renewing the communication of research. These observations are carried out by a team of two researchers, one in language sciences and the other in anthropology. Their analyses will be published in the form of a research report.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The third goal is to draft specifications for the creation of a platform supporting the close collaboration of SSH researchers and journalists involved in a joint research project. The challenge here is to provide the participants first of all with a privileged communication channel as well as a database of different resources needed, but also a toolbox for applications facilitating data sharing and, more largely, collaborative work.\r\n",

      "Elementary school and educational institutions are challenged by not adequately educating children and young people for self-knowledge and solving complex societal challenges. At the same time involving citizens and communities outside traditional research institutions as participants in research systems and professional development has been defined as a megatrend that will influence future research policy. The project Community Drive is in scope with the topic by addressing research-based education development.

The project address three overall challenges: \r\n",

The need to identify key competencies of the future has been the subject of education policy debate for several years.

In Community Drive, a range of tools will be developed based on cases involving 21st century skills and design thinking.\r\n",

      "Challenge 2 addresses the development of a more open and engaged research community. Open research is, first and foremost, a research agenda that can have a greater impact on society. Although it was primarily related to scientific publishing (open access), it also encourages knowledge sharing and involvement among users. Involvement of children and young people in teaching shows great educational potential and a strong motivation for students to participate in authentic research and development processes in collaboration with professional actors. Community Drive investigates how collaboration can be based on citizens’ expertise and professionals’ skills. \r\n",

The smart city and smart society are well-known concepts related to information and communication technology. The collection of information about the city’s “status” can,in collaboration with citizens, be used to optimise resources and offer citizens new and better services. Coommunity Drive focus on the many types of data obtained in a city and the way to enable citizens to collect relevant data about the city. In particular, it will examine how existing data can be represented and applied by both students and other actors.

      "In astronomy the main goal of the research is not, very often, its dissemination to the public. However, its social relevance should be one a starting point. For the public, neither the understanding of the results, nor the processes that led to them, are trivial tasks. This is even more relevant when there is a large increase in scientific production. One way to address this challenge, used by research institutes, is to produce press releases, hoping that social media will echo them. Although this formula has obvious advantages, its randomness and the short-term effect, for example, leads to several limitations and tends to have limited duration and reduced impact on the public lacking awareness of astronomy. Thus, there is an urgent need to create mechanisms / strategies that quickly disseminate results of scientific innovation without discouraging, in the process, the promotion of positive attitudes towards science and the nature of science itself. However, the question is how to do this with the limited human resources and funding normally associated with outreach. To respond to these challenges CoAstro emerged: a citizen science project that aimed the idealization, implementation and evaluation of a scientific dissemination mechanism that would allow the flow of results and scientific processes between researchers and the public, through the involvement of dissemination structures (already present in research institutes) and non-scientific participants (teachers).\n",
      "The high scientific production in astronomy impel us to find new ways to carry out scientific dissemination of content, but also, of processes. Thus, we can promote positive attitudes towards science and the public can more easily deal with bad science, scientific fraud and fake news. In this context CoAstro: @n Astronomy Condo emerged – a citizen science project that directly connected four astronomers, nine elementary school teachers, four science disseminators and one mediator. CoAstro´s, whose first edition lasted an academic year, scientific content and processes were appropriated and integrated by teachers in school initiatives, reaching approximately one thousand people.\r\n",
      "Teachers' involvement in astronomy research took place in two sub-projects: “Stars” and “Planets”. In the first, teachers analyzed standard stellar spectra that allow the qualitative and quantitative composition determination of 57000 stars. In addition, they determined star luminosity using Data Release 2 from the European Space Agency – ESA – GAIA Mission. In the planets project the team started with the production of a planetary transit video, through the Python program. Then, teachers analyzed curves to signal the presence of potential exoplanets. In the process, the mediator was integrated: he adapted the language and created “guidelines for research tasks”. He also ensured the maintenance of the collaborative work, articulating the challenges of research, dissemination and teaching.\r\n",
      "The scientific analysis of CoAstro's results was achieved by implementing a qualitative research. The data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and observations. Results showed high improvements in teachers’ substantive and processual knowledge; positive change in epistemological attitudes and beliefs towards astronomy; as well as, the increasing of the quality of teachers’ scientific dissemination practices.\r\n",
      "Data from astronomers and disseminators, showed one main difference: science disseminators (unlike astronomers), have not changed their perception about teachers´ professional class, due to their participation in CoAstro. Indeed, both groups agree that the project: i) was useful (and facilitated) astronomy dissemination work; ii) it was an opportunity for teachers to increase their procedural knowledge about astronomy; iii) was, at the outset, risky, because of its idea of involving teachers in real astronomy research; iv) reinforced their own perception about the importance and purposes of dissemination practices, promoting new communication skills and new ways of structuring astronomy dissemination activities.\r\n",
      "Although with some implementation difficulties (time, adequacy of tasks ...) CoAstro allowed us to understand how a citizen science project can contribute, with lasting and wide-public-ranging effects, to open the school to the surrounding community and vice-versa and how the public can open up to astronomy research and the latter to the public.\n",

But plastic pollution on beaches and riverbanks in Europe also doesn’t stop at man-made borders. For this reason, avoiding micro- and macroplastics in the environment, a scientific approach to this challenge and researching sustainable materials are tasks which we Europeans must take on together.\r\n",

At the same time, school classes and youth groups are called upon to collect plastic waste along the banks of rivers and streams, to document the various types of the plastic waste collected at different points of a section of a river and actively support research as part of this international citizen science campaign. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Are you a teacher or a leader of a youth group? Have you found a suitable stretch along a river or stream? Then you can get started! Using the detailed project materials, the types of waste identified by the individual groups (e.g. cigarette butts, pieces of film or packaging) are published on a digital map, thus assisting the scientific community in gradually closing gaps in the existing research on the amount of different types of plastic waste. The fight against pollution from plastic waste, for cleaner water and for preserving natural resources for future generations in a united Europe can only be a success if we – the citizens – actively support joint political initiatives in the places we live.\r\n",

The Danube, Europe’s longest river, flows through a total of ten different countries before reaching the Black Sea after traversing some 2,850 kilometres. Unfortunately, it’s not just ships, fish and plant remains that make their way to the sea via rivers.

By collecting plastic waste and uploading data on the amount of waste found, you – together with your school class or extracurricular youth group – can help conduct research on the pollution of bodies of water. You will use a range of methods to understand the pollution by waste in and around the river and to record your findings. The project booklet contains specific instructions for each method. You split into sub-groups, as different groups will tackle different aspects of the study. Uniform experimental guidelines and working steps for all teams which participate ensure that, throughout Europe, the data collected is comparable and will become visible step by step on an online map.\r\n",

However, some have escaped the controlled environment of gardens, and a small minority of these are threatening native biodiversity or are causing severe problems for infrastructure, agriculture or forestry. Well known examples include Japanese Knotweed (Reynoutria japonica), Rhododendron ponticum and Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera).\r\n",

The majority of invasive plants have been initially introduced as ornamental garden plants and then spread from gardens into the wider environment. To prevent more species becoming invasive, gardeners across Britain and Ireland are asked to report ornamental plants that are growing out of control in gardens using an online reporting tool.

      "Understanding adaptation is very valuable in biology because it gives us a greater understanding of how organisms adjust to new conditions and biological scenarios. For example, understanding how the adaptation process occurs can help explain how viruses infect new hosts or how bacteria can resist the effects of certain antibiotics; as well as how some cells can adapt and resist chemotherapy treatments, and how pests can adapt and develop resistance to certain insecticides. \r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "To do this, it is necessary to analyze organisms that both live in, and are exposed to, different environmental conditions, sequencing their genomes, and identifying changes or mutations.

      "The Sensing for Justice (SensJus) project researches the potential of grassroots-driven environmental monitoring, i.e. Citizen Sensing, as a source of evidence in environmental justice litigation, and as a tool for environmental mediation in extra-judicial setting. Our research addresses an urgent need for multi- and interdisciplinary research to understand emerging possibilities of the practice and to provide scientific evidence for decision-making in the EU. The envisaged opportunities of our idea are many, ranging from a closer connection of the affected people to environmental litigation, to a wider, more diverse and inclusive availability of evidence on critical environmental issues, to the possibility of even mitigating the conflict.\n",
      "On June 27, 2019, a landmark court decision was released in Texas, in which a judge found the petrochemical company Formosa Plastics Corporation, liable for violating the Clean Water Act because of plastic discharge into local waters. The case was brought by a civic group based in part on citizen sensed-evidence which involved volunteer observations performed over years. This practice entailing grassroots-driven environmental monitoring could be qualified as ‘Citizen Science’ and, more specifically, ‘Citizen Sensing’. The contamination could not be proved through existing data held by competent authorities since the company never filed any record of pollution with the competent authority. Rather, the monitoring and data collection was almost entirely conducted by local residents.\r\n",
      "Cases such as the Formosa litigation are expected to increase drastically. They pose urgent research questions. Above all, the case motivates an investigation of the potential of introducing Citizen Sensing as a source of evidence in litigation over environmental wrongdoings. Furthermore, Citizen Sensing may also play a role in avoiding the court stage, as a tool to mediate the environmental conflict and to steer the responsible company to adopt an environmentally-compliant behaviour.\r\n",
      "Related research is still in its infancy. The few championing actors in the debate are located in the U.S., not flanked by a parallel inquiry from the European perspective. The key objective of the Sensing for Justice project is to fill this knowledge gap in order to avoid a possible scientific and legislative vacuum, and provide newly required research capacity in the EU.\r\n",
      "The research will be hosted by the European Commission Joint Research Centre, currently leading actor in the research on Citizen Science for environmental monitoring and reporting, which will allow me to play a crucial role in the enactment of measures to release Citizen Science for litigation and mediation’s potential across the EU.\n",

The idea started in 2016 from the collection of observations on roadkilled Vertebrates animals and then extended to the observations on any kind of plant and animals. Up to now projects collect observations of roadkilled animals in the Emilia-Romagna region and in the Po river delta, which is partly in common with the bordering Veneto region and one of the Italian areas richest in wildlife reserves. Other projects collect observations on hoverflies and ground beetles from the entire Italian country, since hoverflies and carabids are one of the main research topics of the Museum of Natural History of Ferrara, that is the owner of the projects. In the last days, a project soliciting the submission of observations made in and around the homes of citizens stuck at home due to Coronavirus emergency was started.\n",

It also allows us to know the phenomena that occur in an episode: this information is used to validate meteorological models and monitoring and surveillance tools.\n",
      "FLOODUP is a citizen science project to improve knowledge about the impact of floods. It has been promoted by GAMA team of University of Barcelona and developed within the framework of AQUELOO (Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology, FECYT-Ministry of Science and Innovation (FCT-18 -13408), PIRAGUA (Interreg POCTEFA-EFA210/16) and AGORA (ACA210/18/00009) projects, promoted by the University of Barcelona and with the collaboration of different institutions. The project aims to collect observations of the impacts of natural hazards, such as floods, good practices of adaptation and bad practices or vulnerable zones. To facilitate participation, an application has been developed for mobile devices (Android and IOS) in Spanish, French, Catalan and English (soon also in Basque). Contributing to the project is very simple and fast and is available to anyone who has a mobile device always with caution and without putting themselves at risk when taking the photograph. Registered users can upload observations using a short form. This form includes issues related to observations, their relationship to climate change, and the acceptability of adaptation measures. The observations, once uploaded by the user, are validated by the project team. Uploaded observations can be consulted on the project map. Educational resources can also be consulted in the App. The project is complemented with participatory workshops and educational activities. The information collected is used in the research works carried out by the group like as a reconstruction of past events. Through surveys and focus groups, the perception and level of resilience of the communities is analyzed.\n",

      "The aim of the project \"Paddle surfing for Science\" is to investigate quantities, properties, behavior and distribution of microplastics in the nearshore at the same time that promoting public understanding of science, overcoming costly research sampling of the nearshore, and raising awareness on plastic pollution in the marine environment.\n",
      "Research on microplastics has rapidly expanded in recent years and has led to the discovery of vast amounts of microplastics floating offshore in all main oceanic gyres and including the Mediterranean Sea. However, there is a lack of information from a few meters from the coastline where the largest plastic mass flux is suspected to occur. The reason behind is the general use of manta trawls towed by boats or research vessels to obtain samples, which hinders nearshore sampling. We have designed a manta trawl to collect samples in the near-shore from any type of recreational sports floating gear like kayaks, sailboats, rowing boats, windsurf boards and others. Data generated is comparable to that obtained with traditional scientific equipment towed from boats. During one year, starting from October 2020, 10 social, environmental or sports associations along the NW Mediterranean coast will be acquiring scientific samples in the nearshore within the frame of two citizen science monitoring projects lead by the Spanish delegation of the non-governmental organization Surfrider Foundation Europe and the University of Barcelona. The projects “Paddle Surfing for Science” and “PlastiPlancton BCN” represent a paradigm shift in microplastic research, allowing to fill the gap in knowledge of this transition coastal area, and actively involving citizens in the generation of new monitoring data. \n",
