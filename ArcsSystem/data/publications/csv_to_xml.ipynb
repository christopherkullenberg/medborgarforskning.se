This plant blindness can be explained by a lack of interest in and focus on plant science in education in favour of animals. However, most life on earth, including humans, depend mainly on plants for food and shelter. Consequently, it is important for society to acknowledge the importance of plants and combat plant blindness. City sidewalk plant communities survive despite the extreme stress factors of urban environments, for instance, drought, access to little soil, high levels of manual disturbance and herbicides. Therefore, these plants are highly adaptable and could show how plants change and survive in extreme environments. Previous studies in urban ecology have shown that plant species richness, and anthropogenic factors can best explain biodiversity. These factors and their role in plant species composition, richness and diversity needs further study to infer which species or species communities are highly successful in these challenging urban environments. To understand the ecology of urban plant communities could help us design sustainable and biodiverse green cities in the future.',\n",

CoAct will define and develop a general framework for Citizen Social Science as a participatory research co-designed and directly driven by citizen groups sharing a social concern. The methodological framework will be first incubated in a consortium with Research Organizations, NGOs and global networks of Open Science and Open Data activism. Expertises from Computational Social Science, Participatory Action Research, Citizen Science evaluation or Citizen-generated Data will be incorporated to conceive a transdisciplinary Citizen Social Science that place vulnerable citizens at the center of Research and Innovation cycles, as co-designers and co-researchers. Secondly, three mission-oriented Actions and at least three Research Pilots will be led by vulnerable citizen groups with the support of Knowledge Coalitions formed by public bodies, CSOs and social innovators. The common effort will harness novel, simultaneously global and local, socially robust knowledge and scientifically reasoned measures to promote social change. An Open Citizen Science toolkit, Open Source digital platforms, and Capacity Building activities to improve data and science literacy, including a PhD Summer School, will be delivered.

This breakthrough will be pursued through three interconnected lines of activity: (i) coordination of citizen science actions and leveraging of existing resources in the presently fragmented landscape of Citizen Science in Europe, (ii) engagement of quadruple helix stakeholders at all levels (local, national and European), and (iii) creation of a mutual learning space and a set of comprehensive codesigned training modules for the different target audiences. Moreover, following a transparent, open and inclusive approach, EU-Citizen.Science will promote interdisciplinary, cross-border, cross-sector collaboration, and give rise to significant social innovation and new business models through the creation of new partnerships and the provision of novel sustainability-supporting tools.<br></p>',\n",

Such an organization shows nowadays two main limitations: (1) the slow process of mediatization of academic knowledge, and (2) perceived low impact of such knowledge for society, especially for disciplines in the fields of the social sciences and the humanities (SSH). The importance of the current phenomenon of massive disinformation in democratic societies can be seen as a direct consequence of this problem of the organization of scientific communication.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo explore a new model for science communication, the PLACES project proposes to bring together practitioners from the two professional worlds of journalism and SSH research, from the very beginning of knowledge production, in order to make them both co-actors of the overall process. The aim is to break down the silos of research practices, by creating the conditions for a dialogue on the modalities of science production (as opposed to vertical communication characterizing the dissemination mode). From this point of view, the project aims to put into practice collaborations following the model of \"Extreme Citizen Science\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTo do so, the PLACES project supports three experimental collaborative researches, each bringing together a SSH researcher and a journalist, with the aim of highlighting the difficulties and obstacles encountered in this type of inter-professional collaboration. In order to synthesize and problematize what has been observed, the three experimental researches are then observed by professional researchers in order to write a research report on the subject and to make proposals for the creation of a specific platform supporting this type of collaboration.',\n",

However, its social relevance should be one a starting point. For the public, neither the understanding of the results, nor the processes that led to them, are trivial tasks. This is even more relevant when there is a large increase in scientific production. One way to address this challenge, used by research institutes, is to produce press releases, hoping that social media will echo them. Although this formula has obvious advantages, its randomness and the short-term effect, for example, leads to several limitations and tends to have limited duration and reduced impact on the public lacking awareness of astronomy. Thus, there is an urgent need to create mechanisms / strategies that quickly disseminate results of scientific innovation without discouraging, in the process, the promotion of positive attitudes towards science and the nature of science itself. However, the question is how to do this with the limited human resources and funding normally associated with outreach. To respond to these challenges CoAstro emerged: a citizen science project that aimed the idealization, implementation and evaluation of a scientific dissemination mechanism that would allow the flow of results and scientific processes between researchers and the public, through the involvement of dissemination structures (already present in research institutes) and non-scientific participants (teachers).',\n",

For example, understanding how the adaptation process occurs can help explain how viruses infect new hosts or how bacteria can resist the effects of certain antibiotics; as well as how some cells can adapt and resist chemotherapy treatments, and how pests can adapt and develop resistance to certain insecticides. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstanding the genetic basis of adaptation can provide us with relevant insight into areas of high economic and social impact, such as medicine, health, agriculture, and climate change. A greater understanding of each of these issues brings enormous potential for achieving greater social well-being.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand how organisms adapt to the environment, we must first identify what is changing within the organism and how it is changing. In biological terms, this means identifying which genes are involved in the process of change, and what molecular mechanisms they are acting through.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo do this, it is necessary to analyze organisms that both live in, and are exposed to, different environmental conditions, sequencing their genomes, and identifying changes or mutations. A suitable organism to carry out these types of genetic studies is a fruit fly that goes by the scientific name, Drosophila.\\r\\n',\n",
