The first Asian hornet appeared in Belgium in 2011. Since then the species has expanded rapidly. This wasp comes from China and is a threat to honeybees and native pollinators. It is considered an invasive alien species and must be managed under the EU invasive species Regulation. The population is managed by exterminating nests. Surveillance requires many eyes on the lookout.</p>\\r\\n\",\"description\":\"<p>Vespawatch target beekeepers, the public and naturalists and uses them as sensors for tracking the progression of invasive Asian hornets (Vespa velutina). The data gathered by citizens are used to inform management and to perform research on the invasion of this insect. Anyone can report opportunistic observations of hornets through the web portal without registration. Data are then synced with iNaturalist and peer validated by the community. After validation, hornet nests are pushed to the management module, to which hornet managers can subscribe. Management actions are reported in the same system. All observations are openly published on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Learning outcomes include an increased awareness on invasive species and ecosystem services provided by native pollinating insects as well as a general increased appreciation for the diversity wasps and insects. More specifically, people learn to identify the different species of hornet and wasp in the region. Additionally, the project actively engages participants in citizen science activities such as ivy bvioblitzes which aim to locate hornet nests.

INBO conducts research and supplies knowledge to all who prepare or make biodiversity related policies or are interested in them. Besides generating new scientific insights, INBO also gathers, reviews and disseminates existing knowledge and promotes knowledge transfer. \\r\\nThe INBO research agenda places strong emphasis on citizen science for biodiversity and environmental monitoring in Flanders. Examples of monitoring strategies that involve the public in the application of uniform monitoring protocols are wildlife camera trapping networks, crowdsourcing, automation of data processing, runinng bioblitzes for invasive species, faunistic surveys etc. Citizen science is an important part of INBO's activities and projects. Examples of projects include the monitoring of invasive Asian hornets using beekeepers and the public (Vespa-Watch), early warning for alien species via citizen science, the monitoring of stag beetle, red listing with naturalist data. The institute is an active partner in the COST project AlienCSI CA17122 Increasing understanding of alien species through citizen science (https://alien-csi.eu).\\r\\nThe mobilization of citizen science data through open data publication using repeatable, open workflows is a core activity at the institute. INBO is a member of INVASIVESNET (www.invasivesnet.org), an association that also wants to strengthen citizen science as part of a strategy around invasive species . INBO is a member of ECSA and actively involved in the Scivil (Flemish knowledge centre for Citizen Science) network (www.scivil.be). INBO strongly believes inclusive citizen science promotes sustainability, increases the legitimacy of science and leads to better decision making.

The citizen science project &lsquo;Looking for Cowslips&rsquo; was carried out already in 2019 and 2020 in Estonia and Latvia. Within the frames of this campaign, we obtained heterostyly data from &gt; 200 000 cowslip individuals in the first year and &gt; 155 000 in the second year. Data originating from the campaign provides unprecedented insight into the patterns of heterostyly following the loss of semi-natural grasslands.</p>\\r\\n\",\"description\":\"<p>Participants are expected to observe the patterns of heterostyly in cowslips. The cowslip (<em>Primula veris</em>) is a heterostylous plant &ndash; it means that the plant can have one of the two types of flowers. These different type of flowers are called S-morphs (short-styled) and&nbsp;L-morphs (long-styled). In short-styled cowslips (S-morphs), five anthers are visible when looking from above, and in individuals with L-type of flowers, we can see one stigma. Normally in cowslip populations, the frequency of these different types of individuals is more or less equal. Imbalance reduces plants&rsquo; opportunities to find a suitable mate for reproduction, which impedes pollination and the exchange of genetic material. This, in turn, reduces plants&rsquo; vitality. The cowslip&rsquo;s regular habitats &ndash; traditionally managed grasslands &ndash; have become increasingly rare in the contemporary landscape. The disappearance of grasslands causes decline in plant populations depending on grassland habitats. A massive decline in cowslip populations can cause substantial imbalances in the frequency of L- and S-morphs to the extent that one of those types completely disappears from the habitat. That is precisely the kind of a possible shift in the balance between the L and S-morphs caused by changes in the landscape that we want to study &ndash; with your help. An observation takes about 30 minutes. When possible, one should observe the flowers of 100 cowslip individuals. Look at the flower and report whether you see five anthers or one stigma.

Besides generating new scientific insights, INBO also gathers, reviews and disseminates existing knowledge and promotes knowledge transfer. \\r\\nThe INBO research agenda places strong emphasis on citizen science for biodiversity and environmental monitoring in Flanders. Examples of monitoring strategies that involve the public in the application of uniform monitoring protocols are wildlife camera trapping networks, crowdsourcing, automation of data processing, runinng bioblitzes for invasive species, faunistic surveys etc. Citizen science is an important part of INBO's activities and projects. Examples of projects include the monitoring of invasive Asian hornets using beekeepers and the public (Vespa-Watch), early warning for alien species via citizen science, the monitoring of stag beetle, red listing with naturalist data. The institute is an active partner in the COST project AlienCSI CA17122 Increasing understanding of alien species through citizen science (https://alien-csi.eu).\\r\\nThe mobilization of citizen science data through open data publication using repeatable, open workflows is a core activity at the institute. INBO is a member of INVASIVESNET (www.invasivesnet.org), an association that also wants to strengthen citizen science as part of a strategy around invasive species . INBO is a member of ECSA and actively involved in the Scivil (Flemish knowledge centre for Citizen Science) network (www.scivil.be). INBO strongly believes inclusive citizen science promotes sustainability, increases the legitimacy of science and leads to better decision making.

This plant blindness can be explained by a lack of interest in and focus on plant science in education in favour of animals. However, most life on earth, including humans, depend mainly on plants for food and shelter. Consequently, it is important for society to acknowledge the importance of plants and combat plant blindness. City sidewalk plant communities survive despite the extreme stress factors of urban environments, for instance, drought, access to little soil, high levels of manual disturbance and herbicides. Therefore, these plants are highly adaptable and could show how plants change and survive in extreme environments. Previous studies in urban ecology have shown that plant species richness, and anthropogenic factors can best explain biodiversity. These factors and their role in plant species composition, richness and diversity needs further study to infer which species or species communities are highly successful in these challenging urban environments.

Researchers will be investigating this together with pupils and teachers across the whole of Sweden in the Food Waste Experiment (Svinnkollen). To assist them, they will be using an artificial intelligence (AI) app and the world&rsquo;s largest food sustainability database. Our food is responsible for over one-third of human-caused climate emissions. At the same time, almost one-third of food produced globally is thrown away. In the Food Waste Experiment, researchers will be developing and testing a new way to reduce food waste in Swedish schools: by providing more information and individual feedback. During the three weeks of the Food Waste Experiment, teachers and pupils will both help develop, and use, an app to find out how much food they are throwing away. The first week, teachers and pupils will train the AI to identify many different kinds of food. Here they will photograph their lunch plates and tell the AI what kinds of food are on the plates. The two following weeks, they will use the app to photograph their plates before and after eating, which will allow the app to calculate how much food is being wasted. Before lunch, they receive information about the day&rsquo;s menu being served in the school dining hall, the nutritional content of the various dishes and their climate footprint. The information comes from the world&rsquo;s largest database on factors relating to food and environmental impact, health and justice, developed by the company Consupedia in collaboration with researchers at Dalarna University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Through the project, researchers want to test whether it is possible to create virtuous circles in how food is dealt with &ndash; from wholesalers through to pupils. Making pupils more aware of how their food is affecting the climate, health and the environment, can lead to more thoughtful choices in the dining hall. As school kitchens get better information about what food the pupils like and dislike, menus can be adapted to better suit the needs of the pupils. The kitchens can then make more tailored orders from the wholesalers, so that the amount of waste is reduced both in school kitchens and at wholesalers.</p>\\r\\n\",\"keywords\":[{\"id\":4,\"keyword\":\"Artificial Intelligence\"},{\"id\":173,\"keyword\":\"food waste\"},{\"id\":174,\"keyword\":\"sustainable consumption\"}],\"status\":{\"id\":5,\"status\":\"Completed\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":12,\"topic\":\"Education\"},{\"id\":13,\"topic\":\"Food science\"},{\"id\":19,\"topic\":\"Information & Computing sciences\"}],\"start_date\":\"2020-11-09\",\"end_date\":\"2020-11-27\",\"url\":\"https://forskarfredag.se/forskarfredags-massexperiment/svinnkollen/\",\"mainOrganisation\":{\"id\":6,\"dateCreated\":\"2020-09-08T06:48:03.452860Z\",\"dateUpdated\":\"2020-09-08T06:48:03.452892Z\",\"name\":\"Vetenskap & AllmÃ¤nhet (VA â€“Â Public & Science)\",\"url\":\"https://v-a.se/english-portal/\",\"description\":\"VA (Public & Science) is a Swedish non-profit membership organisation that works to promote dialogue and openness between researchers and the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nVAâ€™s members consist of some 90 organisations, authorities, universities, companies and associations.

Environmental monitoring systems, such as Copernicus Corine Land Cover, produce a variety of valuable datasets, offered for the entire EU landscape. Yet, the update rate is scarce due to increased costs and timely data validation procedures, while investing in additional in-situ equipment or in maintaining the current infrastructure is unsustainable. Citizen science constitutes an innovative approach of environmental monitoring, capable to complement the existing Earth Observation and in-situ infrastructure with up-to-date information about local ecosystems.  The majority of citizens however, both as individuals and as groups quite often feel disengaged from influencing environmental policies, whilst also remain unaware of publicly available information and initiatives. \\r\\nSCENT Citizen Observatory project has created a toolbox (https://scent-project.eu/scent-toolbox) of smart collaborative technologies and applications that aims to engage citizens with environmental monitoring, enabling them to become the â€˜eyesâ€™ of the policy makers and local authorities. Citizens are using low-cost equipment to collect various environmental information (land cover/use, river parameters, soil conditions), that are consolidated to improve flood modelling and are offered to the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) in an interoperable way, following common environmental standards (Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards). \",\"description\":\"The project designed, developed and implemented a people-centric observation web, formulated on the basis of using low-cost, portable sensors and innovative applications.  The SCENT toolbox offers various capabilities involving crowdsourcing and serious gaming mechanisms towards enabling, incentivising and increasing the involvement of citizens as individuals and/or citizen groups/associations in the process of environmental monitoring. By using their smartphones and portable sensors, citizens can take images of land cover / land use while walking around in their city or the countryside, report events that may affect floods (e.g. river obstacles) and measure water level, flow velocity and soil moisture, without complex or bulky equipment. They are doing this in a playful manner, through a game of â€˜catchingâ€™ animated animals in their surroundings and collecting points. \\r\\nOn top of that, novel frameworks are employed to ensure the management, quality control and interoperability of citizen-generated data, coupled with machine learning frameworks that extract valuable information from the collected resources and thus lead to better use of available data, repositories and in-situ monitoring systems. Last but not least, apart from extending the in-situ infrastructure with citizen-sourced observations, the use of the latter was demonstrated in the context of creating flood models and land cove / use maps of enhanced characteristics that can improve decision making.  \\r\\nAdditionally, the value of the SCENT toolbox was demonstrated in two regions in real but diverse examples where flood monitoring is of great importance. The first region is the wetland of Danube Delta in Romania, where flooding is a necessary and beneficial part of maintaining the ecosystem, and the second is the Kifisos River basin around the urban landscape of Athens in Greece, where flooding is a major problem for the local communities.\\r\\nVarious citizen-science campaigns (10 in total) were conducted during 2018 & 2019 in these regions. These field campaigns were organised in different periods in both pilots covering in total 11 months, while focusing on themes of interest to the local communities and the policy makers such as the collection of LC/LU elements, river parameters and soil measurements. The objective of the campaigns was to collect valuable environmental information, at frequent time intervals, that could be further analysed and used. \\r\\nMore than 700 volunteers participated in the field campaigns, testing, evaluating and validating the SCENT toolbox, while also contributing with a significant amount of 24200+ environmental resources in both pilot areas. It should be noted, that SCENT has at the same time established an active online community, involving, as of August 2019, 1130+ active registered users of its public facing applications (SCENT Explore, SCENT Collaborate, SCENT Measure, https://scent-project.eu/scent-toolbox). \",\"keywords\":[{\"id\":32,\"keyword\":\"Citizen Observatories\"},{\"id\":51,\"keyword\":\"land use land cover monitoring\"}],\"status\":{\"id\":5,\"status\":\"Completed\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":5,\"topic\":\"Biodiversity\"},{\"id\":11,\"topic\":\"Ecology & Environment\"},{\"id\":19,\"topic\":\"Information & Computing sciences\"},{\"id\":24,\"topic\":\"Natural resource management\"}],\"start_date\":\"2016-09-01\",\"end_date\":\"2019-08-31\",\"url\":\"https://scent-project.eu/\",\"mainOrganisation\":{\"id\":62,\"dateCreated\":\"2020-11-13T09:04:19.169649Z\",\"dateUpdated\":\"2020-11-13T09:04:19.169666Z\",\"name\":\"Institute Of Communication and Computer Systems\",\"url\":\"https://www.iccs.gr/en/?noredirect=en_US | https://i-sense.iccs.gr/\",\"description\":\"The Institute of Communications and Computer Systems (ICCS) is a non-profit academic research body established in 1989 by the Greek Ministry of Education to carry out research and development activities in the area of telecommunications, systems and techniques, computer systems and their applications in transceivers, radar, electromagnetic sensors, satellite and wireless communications, electromagnetic phenomena modelling, neural networks, systems, software and hardware engineering, telematics and multimedia applications, transport applications, control systems, biomedical engineering and electric power (www.iccs.gr).

The pivotal importance of cartilaginous fish for marine ecosystems is highlighted by the fact that most shark and some ray species constitute top predators, thus possess central and stabilizing functions in marine food webs. Based on the latest report of IUCN at least half of the rays (50%, 16 of 32 species) in the Mediterranean Sea face an elevated risk of extinction, as well as 54% of sharks (22 of 41). The principal driver for this is overfishing along with the life history characteristics of these species (low reproductive, slow growth rates and long life spans). In Greek Seas at least 67 species of cartilaginous fish are present but existing knowledge on their distribution, ecology and biology is still limited. In Cyprus, studies related to the presence/biology of cartilaginous fish are limited and deficient.

One characteristic that makes birds so fascinating is their spectacular colouration. From the striking iridescence of hummingbirds to the vibrant colours of macaws, birds have evolved an astounding diversity of colours and patterns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the colours that we can see, many bird species can also perceive light in the ultraviolet (UV) range of the spectrum. The discovery that many birds see and respond to UV colouration has had a significant impact on how researchers now measure bird plumage colouration, as well as on our understanding of how birds see each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur team is hoping to measure the dazzling array of plumage colouration in birds to gain a better understanding of how and why spectacular animal colouration evolves. Some of the key questions we hope to answer are:\\r\\n\\r\\nJust how colourful are birds?\\r\\nHow quickly does plumage colour evolve?\\r\\nAre evolutionary changes in plumage colour associated with the origin of new species?\",\"description\":\"1. Selecting specimens\\r\\nSpecimens are selected from the bird collections at the Natural History Museum, London. Where possible, three males and three females are chosen for each species. Our aim is to photograph as many bird species as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Photographs: human-visible and UV light\\r\\nWe photograph each specimen with a specialist camera that can capture human-visible (400â€“700 nm) and ultraviolet (UV, 300â€“400 nm) wavelengths of light. We take photos in pairs, first with a filter that only transmits human-visible wavelength and second with a filter that only transmits UV wavelengths. We take six photographs of each specimen:\\r\\n\\r\\na. Back view â€” visible + UV\\r\\nb. Side view â€” visible + UV\\r\\nc. Belly view â€” visible + UV\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Zooniverse!\\r\\nTo make sense of the colour information stored in the photographs, we need to identify different areas of the bird's plumage, such as the crown, breast and tail. Colour in these different \\\"patches\\\" can serve different functions in different species, often including signalling (e.g. attracting mates, warning predators). We need your help to mark each of 10 different patches on the photographs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two main workflow types: points and outline.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€“ Points - place points to locate 10 key bird body regions.\\r\\nâ€“ Outline - trace the outline by drawing a polygonâ€‹ around the edge of the bird\\r\\n\\r\\nEach workflow can be performed on three different views of the bird (back, side, belly).\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Data & Discoveries\\r\\nThe points you place provide us with {X,Y} coordinates telling us where to measure within each image. Based on this information, we then extract data on colouration and pattern for each specimen, which we use to tackle important unanswered questions on the causes of evolution of colouration and the role that colour differences play in the origin of species.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Outcomes\\r\\nThe database that you can help to build starts from museum collections. Our aim is to pass the data back to the NHM via the Data Portal. This means that you will be contributing not only to research on bird evolution but also helping to build a digital legacy of museum collections.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can you help?\\r\\nWe need your help to identify key areas of bird plumages to generate the raw data we need to tackle big, unanswered questions about evolution. Along the way, you will:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. See a dazzling array of plumages from many thousands of species â€“ some of which are now vanishingly rare\\r\\n2. Explore hidden dimensions of plumage colouration by studying both human-visible and UV images of birds\\r\\n3.

Although the 2019-nCoV spike protein of interest has not yet been resolved bound to ACE2, our objective is to use the homologous structure of the SARS-CoV spike protein to identify therapeutic antibody targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other distributed computing projects, Folding@home is an online citizen science project. In these projects non-specialists contribute computer processing power or help to analyse data produced by professional scientists. Participants in these projects play an invaluable role in facilitating research for little or no obvious reward.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch has been carried out into the motivations of citizen scientists and most of these studies have found that participants are motivated to take part because of altruistic reasons, that is, they want to help scientists and make a contribution to the advancement of their research. Many participants in citizen science have an underlying interest in the topic of the research and gravitate towards projects that are in disciplines of interest to them. Folding@home is no different in that respect. Research carried out recently on over 400 active participants revealed that they wanted to help make a contribution to research and that many had friends or relatives affected by the diseases that the Folding@home scientists investigate.\",\"keywords\":[],\"status\":{\"id\":2,\"status\":\"Active\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":7,\"topic\":\"Biology\"},{\"id\":9,\"topic\":\"Chemical sciences\"},{\"id\":17,\"topic\":\"Health & Medicine\"},{\"id\":19,\"topic\":\"Information & Computing sciences\"}],\"start_date\":\"2000-10-01\",\"end_date\":null,\"url\":\"https://foldingathome.org/2020/02/27/foldinghome-takes-up-the-fight-against-covid-19-2019-ncov/\",\"mainOrganisation\":null,\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"38.634579\",\"longitude\":\"-90.263109\",\"country\":\"US\",\"author\":\"St Louis School of Medicine\",\"author_email\":\"\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-06_101004044444_830_fahfeat.jpg\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-06_101004044444_256_foldingathome-logo.png\",\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-06_101004044444_84_xl_foldingathome_0780043801666020.jpg\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"Washington University\",\"howToParticipate\":\"The Folding@home software runs while you do other things.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile you keep going with your everyday activities, your computer will be working to help us find cures for diseases like cancer, ALS, Parkinsonâ€™s, Huntingtonâ€™s, Influenza and many others.

SfC specializes in developing user-centered, innovative services and products based on citizen science, participatory strategies, community engagement and co-creation processes to facilitate social innovation. It focuses on environmental issues affecting citizens, or any other matters of concern, and uses a methodology based on a quadruple helix model of stakeholder engagement (public authorities and policy makers, industries and SMEs, academia, and communities, NGOs and CSOs, amongst others), to promote dialogue, increase transparency, and to co-design innovative solutions that are relevant to all the stakeholders involved. The identified stakeholders are involved in every step of the process: from the co-design of the research question, to the definition and the data gathering strategy, to its validation, analysis and co-design of solutions. Through data gathering and its analysis, new technologies and crowdsourcing, SfC empower communities using a bottom-up approach to co-design local solutions adapted to each local case, while promoting social innovation and the participation of citizens in decision-making processes that affect their quality of life. SfC has been created for the exploitation of results of the EU H2020 project D-NOSES (Distributed Network for Odour Sensing, Empowerment and Sustainability) with the aim of replicating the innovative methodology developed to co-design alternative solutions to odour pollution using citizen science and co-creation methodologies and a bottom-up approach.

TILTâ€™s expertise covers a wide array of domains (e-government, e-commerce, e-health, cybersecurity), technologies (bio-, nano, neuro- technologies, robotics), and topics (privacy, identity management, cybercrime, intellectual- property rights, etc.). LTMSâ€™ research programme is premised on the notion of a mutual shaping of technology, regulation, and normative outlooks. In the most recent five-year research assessment, TILT received 4.75 out of 5, ranking second (with seven others) out of 60 Dutch research programmes. Tilburg Law School was assessed the best Dutch law faculty, averaging 4.47 out of 5. \\r\\n \\r\\nLTMSâ€™ research is mainly performed within large international (EU-funded) and national projects (publiclyprivately funded or funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research â€“ NWO). TILTâ€™s input in these projects is guided by an overarching five-year research programme. The overall aim of this programme is to gain a deeper understanding of the complex ways in which technology, regulation, and normative outlooks interact and shape each other. We investigate the ways in which technological developments affect regulation, basic societal patterns and normative frameworks and vice versa.

BISG has conducted research in national and international research projects funded by the Academy of Finland, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation Tekes, also as international collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science JSPS and the USA National Science Foundation NSF, and the European Union. The group has participated many robotic EU framework projects and has been granted funded research from Tekes and Academy of Finland for more than ten millions euros. Robotics research activity at BISG includes collaboration with e.g. processing industry. The groupâ€™s research activity has spun off more than ten several enterprises, e.g. Codenomicon, Clarified Networks, Atomia, Probot, Indoor Atlas.\",\"logo\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2021-02-15_010102023030_94_UOULUlogoV.png\",\"contactPoint\":\"Dr. Ulrico Celentano\",\"contactPointEmail\":\"ulrico.celentano@oulu.fi\",\"latitude\":\"65.011873\",\"longitude\":\"25.471681\",\"country\":\"FI\",\"creator\":2545,\"orgType\":3}],\"latitude\":\"65.015269\",\"longitude\":\"-39.651497\",\"country\":\"GL\",\"author\":\"Dr. Huma Shah\",\"author_email\":\"ab7778@coventry.ac.uk\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2021-02-15_121202023333_767_CSI-COP%20colour%20no%20text.jpg\",\"imageCredit1\":\"David Goodman: TDL\",\"image2\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2021-01-30_040401014444_180_CSI-COP%20colour.jpg\",\"imageCredit2\":\"David Goodman, TDL\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2021-02-15_020202022222_432_Partners%20logos%20(002).jpg\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":null,\"howToParticipate\":\"<p>Free informal education will equip interested people from the general public to gain knowledge of the <strong>human right to privacy</strong> online, and the practical skills to uncover cookies and third-party trackers on websites and in apps.The accessible informal education will be available through an online workshop (MOOC), and subject to covid19-restrictions, face-to-face 1/2 day workshops in CSI-COP consortium partner countries.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>More information will be available in early Spring 2021.

Citizen Scientists worldwide can participate via the online platform Zooniverse by watching short videos of two bird species - greylag geese and northern bald ibis - at their nests and helping us to find out more about their breeding behaviour. The greylag goose is long-term socially monogamous whereas the endangered northern bald ibis is seasonal monogamous. Both avian model species are free-flying and habituated to the close presence of humans. The birds of the KLF are individually marked with leg rings and the social behaviour of the flock of greylag geese and the colony of northern bald ibis has been monitored over decades. In this project we investigate which behavioural patterns contribute to reproductive success. For this purpose, we equipped a number of breeding facilities with video-cameras that record the behaviour of the breeding birds. In geese, the breeding huts are located on water; for the northern bald ibises the camera is installed in nest-niches in a free flight aviary. Because of the large amount of data collected at the nests, we rely on the involvement of volunteers for the analysis. The citizen scientists code short videos of the birds at the nest and also support the project by asking questions and suggesting improvements in the &quot;Talk&quot;.

These are some of the questions we asked our citizen and received exciting answers and stories, which we have collected in our anecdotes book.

This breakthrough will be pursued through three interconnected lines of activity: (i) coordination of citizen science actions and leveraging of existing resources in the presently fragmented landscape of Citizen Science in Europe, (ii) engagement of quadruple helix stakeholders at all levels (local, national and European), and (iii) creation of a mutual learning space and a set of comprehensive codesigned training modules for the different target audiences. Moreover, following a transparent, open and inclusive approach, EU-Citizen.Science will promote interdisciplinary, cross-border, cross-sector collaboration, and give rise to significant social innovation and new business models through the creation of new partnerships and the provision of novel sustainability-supporting tools.</p>\\r\\n\",\"description\":\"<p>EU-Citizen.Science is a 3-year project, aimed to build the Platform for Sharing, Initiating, and Learning Citizen Science in Europe.

Its scientific, societal, and political impacts increase substantially and are widely recognised. However - and this is also to be welcomed - this is happening largely uncoordinated and without a common agenda. The platform is intended to create a common place in terms of communication, exchange, information gathering and networking.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Over a decade of activity in citizen science has resulted in an enormous range of approaches, tools, resources, projects and impacts; whilst this can be seen as a strength, it may also dilute effort, result in duplication or be a barrier to the newcomer.

The consortium consists of 21 partners, who in turn act as multipliers and, through their participation in the EU-Citizen.Science project, build, strengthen or link national and/or disciplinary networks on Citizen Science. EU-Citizen.Science has engaged from the proposal stage the key actors in implementing citizen science initiatives at European level (either as project partners, third parties or project supporters), together with newcomers that will introduce citizen science practice in their respective countries, thus filling the gaps in the European map. The EU-Citizen.Science project involves 14 partners and 9 third parties, representing 14 European Member States and a variety of stakeholders ranging from universities, NGOs, local authorities, CSOs, SMEs and natural history museums. Many of the partners are already engaged in other SwafS projects related to RRI, co-creation and citizen science, as well as numerous initiatives at national or local level. We leverage the tremendous European potential in regard to capacities, skills, and know-how gained within the European projects and the varied stakeholder communities actively involved in citizen science.</p>\\r\\n\",\"keywords\":[{\"id\":40,\"keyword\":\"citizen science\"},{\"id\":41,\"keyword\":\"platform\"},{\"id\":42,\"keyword\":\"infraestructure\"}],\"status\":{\"id\":2,\"status\":\"Active\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":26,\"topic\":\"Science policy\"}],\"start_date\":\"2019-01-01\",\"end_date\":\"2021-12-31\",\"url\":\"http://eu-citizen.science/\",\"mainOrganisation\":{\"id\":73,\"dateCreated\":\"2021-02-24T17:23:21.652503Z\",\"dateUpdated\":\"2021-02-24T17:23:21.652516Z\",\"name\":\"Museum fÃ¼r Naturkunde Berlin\",\"url\":\"https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en\",\"description\":\"The Museum fÃ¼r Naturkunde Berlin  â€“ Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science â€“ is an integrated research museum within the Leibniz Association.

IBERCIVIS was legally established in 2012 but the consortium has been working closely since 2007 both in Spain and Portugal (see www.ibercivis.pt). Since then, we have deployed more than 60 experiments from 40 different research groups reaching over 60.000 citizen scientists. Ours set of experiments and include volunteer computing (e.g. simulation of nuclear fusion devices yielding on average 8 million hours and 2.3 TFLOPS), volunteer sensing (e.g. odour nuisances reports: OdourCollect), participatory experiments (e.g. human behaviour in dilemma), or collective intelligence projects (e.g. collective music composition) among others. We support groups with hardware (e.g. hosting, load balance, security services), middleware (e.g. tech eulogies such as BOINC, PyBossa, EpiCollect) and software development (e.g. multi device developments or libraries such as gromacs or autodock).

Take spider pictures and investigate spider colour and webs to discover if spiders adapt to living in the city.\",\"description\":\"Have you ever walked around the city in the summer? Then you know it can get very hot because of all the asphalt and the concrete that retains the heat! Staying cool in this heat is not only a problem for humans, but also for animals. But this is just one of the challenges they face. The city is a completely new environment that they must be able to adapt to. Cities can therefore be seen as \\\"living laboratories\\\" where evolution takes place in real time! In the SPIDER-CITY project we want to investigate how spiders can adapt to city life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe focus on two important spider traits: colour and webs. \\r\\nSpider colour. Much like a white car heats up less in the sun compared to a black car, so does a lighter spider heat up less compared to a dark spider. Therefore we expect city spiders to evolve a more lighter colour as this protects them from overheating in an already hot city. \\r\\nSpider webs. As the main tool for prey capture, webs are crucial for spider survival. Due to a lower supply of prey in cities, we expect to see webs with a smaller mesh size that are more efficient in capturing prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow?  \\r\\nCitizen scientists are a crucial part of the SPIN-CITY project! Using the SPIDERSPOTTER app you can take spider photos and report specific observations. You can analyze your own photos and those of others on the SPINNENSPOTTER website to determine spider color, length and web size. An interactive map ensures that our results are accessible to everyone who is interested!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy study adaptations to city living in spiders?\\r\\nNot only do we get crucial information about how animals can adapt to climate change, studying spiders can also be very useful for us humans! We can use spider color as a natural thermometer and thus better determine how quickly our environment heats up. And who knows, by examining in detail how a spider uses color to stay cool, we might even find new ways of staying cool in the city ourselves!\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more about SPIDERSPOTTER and the SPIDER-CITY project on www.spiderspotter.com!\\r\\n\",\"keywords\":[],\"status\":{\"id\":2,\"status\":\"Active\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":2,\"topic\":\"Animals\"},{\"id\":7,\"topic\":\"Biology\"},{\"id\":23,\"topic\":\"Nature & outdoors\"}],\"start_date\":\"2019-09-11\",\"end_date\":null,\"url\":\"www.spiderspotter.com\",\"mainOrganisation\":null,\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"51.035392\",\"longitude\":\"3.722528\",\"country\":\"BE\",\"author\":\"Bram Vanthournout\",\"author_email\":\"spiderspotter@UGent.be\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-21_090904045656_818_Promo_01_1280x800.jpg\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-21_090904045656_154_SPS_Logo_SocialMedia_Avatar_980px.png\",\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-21_090904045858_991_Citizen_Science_Expo-49.jpg\",\"imageCredit3\":\"An Van Gijsegem\",\"host\":\"UGent\",\"howToParticipate\":\"\",\"doingAtHome\":true,\"equipment\":\"smartphone, laptop\",\"fundingBody\":null,\"fundingProgram\":\"\",\"originDatabase\":null,\"originURL\":\"\",\"originUID\":\"\",\"featured\":false,\"customField\":[],\"dateCreated\":\"2020-04-21T09:53:53.285243Z\",\"origin\":\"\"},{\"id\":239,\"name\":\"The Neureka Project\",\"aim\":\"<p>The Neureka Project aims to develop new ways of detecting disorders of the brain early.

IBERCIVIS was legally established in 2012 but the consortium has been working closely since 2007 both in Spain and Portugal (see www.ibercivis.pt). Since then, we have deployed more than 60 experiments from 40 different research groups reaching over 60.000 citizen scientists. Ours set of experiments and include volunteer computing (e.g. simulation of nuclear fusion devices yielding on average 8 million hours and 2.3 TFLOPS), volunteer sensing (e.g. odour nuisances reports: OdourCollect), participatory experiments (e.g. human behaviour in dilemma), or collective intelligence projects (e.g. collective music composition) among others. We support groups with hardware (e.g. hosting, load balance, security services), middleware (e.g. tech eulogies such as BOINC, PyBossa, EpiCollect) and software development (e.g. multi device developments or libraries such as gromacs or autodock). Despite ICT and virtual experiments are our focus, due to the digitally enabled borderless transformation of research, reaching new scales of number and range of contributors, we also work offline with expanded laboratories open to the public such as fablabs or wet labs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe deploy, support and promote the general public engagement in science with research and educational purposes. We play a central role in the Citizen Science Community at local, national and international levels. We are the national institution of Spain promoting citizen science and we run the portal Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain (www.ciencia-ciudadana.es) We are part of the steering committee of the European Citizen Science Association, linking it with responsible research and innovation, working on the adaptation of the RRI-Tools self reflection tool for the CitSci communities and #CitSciChatES among other actives. Since 2012 we coordinate the European project Socientize (www.socientize.eu) which delivered the White Paper on Citizen Science for Europe, referenced as a flagship document for the citizen science policy making. IBERCIVIS and Socientize have been referenced as best practices by several institutions and initiatives, highlighting the European Commission, the Australian Citizen Science Association, RRI-Tools, RRI-ICT, Ars Electronica or Cotec Foundation among others. IBERCIVIS has been marked as good practice in several scenarios, including open governance and grass-roots initiatives. We set up the interaction between science and society for scientific policy making in Socientize. In addition to create the inclusive scenarios for citizen-lead projects, we support social innovation by providing scientific resources and equipment for citizen involvement in scientific research.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"logo\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-07_101009094141_643_LOGO_DEF_1.png\",\"contactPoint\":\"Francisco Sanz\",\"contactPointEmail\":\"info@ibercivis.es\",\"latitude\":\"41.684275\",\"longitude\":\"-0.887436\",\"country\":\"ES\",\"creator\":1,\"orgType\":2},\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"41.684547\",\"longitude\":\"-0.887328\",\"country\":\"ES\",\"author\":\"Francisco Sanz\",\"author_email\":\"info@ibercivis.es\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_020203035858_899_vigilantes_despierta_aragon-1000x675.jpg\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_020203035858_661_logo_vigilantes_aire-1.png\",\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_020203035959_98_vigilantes_despierta_aragon-1000x675.jpg\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"Ibercivis Foundation\",\"howToParticipate\":\"Citizens only have to go to one of the collection points indicated (announced by social networks, press, radio, TV), and can take home a measuring station, in this case a strawberry plant.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy taking responsibility for looking after one of the measuring stations, the citizen is making a commitment to science.

In this project we investigate, which animals are killed on roads and which factors are influencing roadkills. Your data allows us to identify roadkill hotspots. Our vision is to mitigate those hotspots in cooperation with local authorities.\\r\\nWhat does roadkill mean?\\r\\n\\r\\nRoadkills are all animals killed on roads. In most countries, official data on roadkills are only available for huntable wildlife. In the year 2012, amongst others 24852 European hare, 36865 Roe deer, 1414 European badgers were killed on roads in Austria. However, there are no data available on the effects of roads on non-huntable wildlife or red list species such as European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) or European green toad (Bufo viridis).\\r\\nWhy is roadkill important?\\r\\n\\r\\nHabitat fragmentation by roads has a severe impact on many animal species, particularly for those with high mobility or seasonal migration behaviour, such as mammals or amphibians. As a consequence, roadkill is one of the main reasons for the decrease of populations of several animal groups. Compared to a human flat, habitat fragmentation is like a road right in your corridor, seperating your living room from your kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals cross roads when foraging, in mating season (like deer, which cover long distances in search for a mating partner in autumn) or changing from winter to summer habitat (like amphibians). Species which migrate over long distances are especially affected by roadkill.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumans are also affected by roadkill.

IBERCIVIS was legally established in 2012 but the consortium has been working closely since 2007 both in Spain and Portugal (see www.ibercivis.pt). Since then, we have deployed more than 60 experiments from 40 different research groups reaching over 60.000 citizen scientists. Ours set of experiments and include volunteer computing (e.g. simulation of nuclear fusion devices yielding on average 8 million hours and 2.3 TFLOPS), volunteer sensing (e.g. odour nuisances reports: OdourCollect), participatory experiments (e.g. human behaviour in dilemma), or collective intelligence projects (e.g. collective music composition) among others. We support groups with hardware (e.g. hosting, load balance, security services), middleware (e.g. tech eulogies such as BOINC, PyBossa, EpiCollect) and software development (e.g. multi device developments or libraries such as gromacs or autodock). Despite ICT and virtual experiments are our focus, due to the digitally enabled borderless transformation of research, reaching new scales of number and range of contributors, we also work offline with expanded laboratories open to the public such as fablabs or wet labs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe deploy, support and promote the general public engagement in science with research and educational purposes. We play a central role in the Citizen Science Community at local, national and international levels. We are the national institution of Spain promoting citizen science and we run the portal Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain (www.ciencia-ciudadana.es) We are part of the steering committee of the European Citizen Science Association, linking it with responsible research and innovation, working on the adaptation of the RRI-Tools self reflection tool for the CitSci communities and #CitSciChatES among other actives. Since 2012 we coordinate the European project Socientize (www.socientize.eu) which delivered the White Paper on Citizen Science for Europe, referenced as a flagship document for the citizen science policy making. IBERCIVIS and Socientize have been referenced as best practices by several institutions and initiatives, highlighting the European Commission, the Australian Citizen Science Association, RRI-Tools, RRI-ICT, Ars Electronica or Cotec Foundation among others. IBERCIVIS has been marked as good practice in several scenarios, including open governance and grass-roots initiatives.

Users do not require any prior scientific knowledge. These species are often found in urban areas cross the UK. Importantly, this  easy to use app can be used in any area to anonymously record and map  sightings and the freely available downloadable database can be used to monitor and build up a map of species distribution. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis app enables mapping, monitoring and recording of urban wildlife including pollinators in our urban areas such as cities streets, parks, school grounds and gardens where traditionally less monitoring has been carried out.\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"description\":\"UMAPIT is a bespoke app that has been developed by University of Manchester to allow users of any age without prior scientific training, to learn about urban species and record their wildlife sightings in an easy and accessible way. The aim is to encourage users to become aware and appreciate the wildlife in our urban environments. Using the recordings database for knowledge co-creation, scientists can download the sighting recorded by citizens, along with dates of the observations and GPS coordinates. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe UMAPIT app is free of charge and is available on android. The app allows users to find out more about the species, capture details of species they encounter in the field, anonymously record their sightings on a map and send their records direct to the website database. The app facilitates automatic recording of sightings with GPS locations and dates and users can also add notes on particular sighting. Records can be sent to the website database immediately via the app if a reliable internet connection is available. Alternatively, information and locations can be entered manually via the website (www.UMAPIT.org) using any mobile or desktop device with an internet connection. \\r\\n\\r\\nRecorded data, including dates and GPS data, are free to download from the UMAPIT website. This data can be used by scientists to monitor occurrences and distribution changes in urban wildlife.

About 2% of the total number of asteroids are classified as NEAs (Near-Earth Objects) and about 10% -2000 are PHAs or potentially dangerous asteroids for the Earth, that is, asteroids with a non-zero probability of impact against our planet. The Minor Planet Center of the International Astronomical Union is the body that records the asteroid database, maintained with the observations of professional astronomers and amateurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers at the Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid (UPM) and the Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica de Canarias (IAC) have developed an app that allows anyone, and in a friendly way, to help control the population of asteroids. It is a free application for mobile devices called â€œcazasteroidesâ€�. Being a asteroid hunter is simple, it only requires having the app installed (in its Android version, iOS or in a web browser) and visual acuity. The user sees in their mobile a sequence of images of the sky and marks those objects suspected of being asteroids â€“ they move on the fixed background of stars. The detections are first filtered by the users themselves â€“ through a voting system â€“ and finally it will be a team of professional astronomers that verify the true nature of the objects detected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe application includes gamification techniques to make it more attractive to users, rewarding them with points for their actions. The project of Asteroid Hunters already has a large community of users and other large figures: the more than 6,420 users have added a total of 209,000 detections, 1,25 M votes cast, 3,700 known objects and 760 candidates, that is, there is a total of 760 objects that the MPC does not have cataloged and that for now have been approved as possible new asteroids.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final goal in the medium term is to have a worldwide network of telescopes that contribute their images and are part of this application so that, in a very fast and thanks to the collaboration of thousands of citizens, the population of dangerous objects can be controlled.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œThe visual acuity of young people will allow us to detect weaker, and therefore smaller, asteroids than with traditional image recognition algorithms. The key is to get thousands of citizens involved in the project. It is the task of all to protect the future of our planet and hunters will be our shield against objects that come very close to the Earth\\\", comments Miquel Serra-Ricart, the astronomer coordinating the project.\",\"keywords\":[],\"status\":{\"id\":2,\"status\":\"Active\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":4,\"topic\":\"Astronomy & Space\"},{\"id\":12,\"topic\":\"Education\"}],\"start_date\":\"2016-11-01\",\"end_date\":null,\"url\":\"cazasteroides.org\",\"mainOrganisation\":null,\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"40.405034\",\"longitude\":\"-3.700149\",\"country\":\"ES\",\"author\":\"Raquel Cedazo LeÃ³n\",\"author_email\":\"cazasteroides@gmail.com\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-28_070704042424_613_logo-cazasteroides-600-400.png\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-28_070704042424_354_logo-cazasteroides-600-400.png\",\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-28_070704042424_707_header-cazasteroides.png\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid\",\"howToParticipate\":\"Only a mobile phone is required, to download the app Android or iOS, or even from the computer's browser.\",\"doingAtHome\":true,\"equipment\":\"Internet.\",\"fundingBody\":null,\"fundingProgram\":\"Convocatoria de ayudas 2015 para el fomento de la cultura cientÃ­fica, tecnolÃ³gica y de la innovaciÃ³n\",\"originDatabase\":null,\"originURL\":\"\",\"originUID\":\"\",\"featured\":false,\"customField\":[],\"dateCreated\":\"2020-04-28T07:19:24.945437Z\",\"origin\":\"\"},{\"id\":39,\"name\":\"IdentificaciÃ³n de asteroides cercanos a la Tierra (Near-Earth Asteroids precovery)\",\"aim\":\"This is an educational programme conducted by the Spanish Virtual Observatory whose main goal is to offer students, amateur astronomers and the public in general the possibility of identifying in astronomical archives asteroids that may hit the Earth.\",\"description\":\"The Virtual Observatory (VO) is an international initiative whose main goal is to ensure an efficient access and analysis of the information hosted in astronomical archives. In the framework of the Spanish Virtual Observatory we have taken advantage of the VO standards to develop a system to easily access astronomical archives and look for PHAs and  NEAs. At the moment, the public access is limited to the Sloan Digitized Sky Survey (SDSS) and the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS).\\r\\n\\r\\nPrecovery is the process of finding an object in astronomical archives generally for the purpose of calculating a more accurate orbit. Calculating the orbit of an astronomical object involves measuring its position on multiple occasions: The more widely separated these are in time, the more accurately the orbit can be calculated. Accurate determination of the orbital parameters is of fundamental importance for objects like asteroids with a non-negligible probability of impacting Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nApophis is an excellent example of how important Precovery can be. Discovered on June 19, 2004, follow-up observations indicated a small probability (up to 2.7%) that it would strike Earth in 2029. It was not until precovery images taken in March 2004 were analyzed when the possibility of an impact on Earth was eliminated.Apophis belongs to the category of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). These objects are characterized by an Earth Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance(MOID) of 0.05 astronomical units (AU) or less and an absolute magnitude (H) of 22.0 or less. This \\\"potential\\\" to make close Earth approaches does not mean a PHA will impact Earth. It only means there is a possibility for such a threat. By monitoring these PHAs and updating their orbits, we can better predict the close-approach statistics and thus their Earth-impact threat. The same approach applies for Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), objects whose orbits partly lie between 0.983 and 1.3 astronomical units.\",\"keywords\":[{\"id\":80,\"keyword\":\"astronomy\"},{\"id\":81,\"keyword\":\"asteroids\"},{\"id\":82,\"keyword\":\"virtual observatory\"}],\"status\":{\"id\":2,\"status\":\"Active\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":4,\"topic\":\"Astronomy & Space\"},{\"id\":25,\"topic\":\"Physics\"}],\"start_date\":null,\"end_date\":null,\"url\":\"\",\"mainOrganisation\":null,\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"40.489786\",\"longitude\":\"-3.474598\",\"country\":\"ES\",\"author\":\"Enrique Solano MÃ¡rquez\",\"author_email\":\"divulgacion@cab.inta-csic.es\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_080803030202_557_ast1b.png\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_080803030202_437_logo-svo-ns.png\",\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_080803030303_654_ast1b.png\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"Centro de AstrobiologÃ­a, Instituto Nacional de TÃ©cnica Aeroespacial INTA-CSIC\",\"howToParticipate\":\"The procedure of identifying PHAs and NEAs relies on the comparison of images of the same region of the sky taken several minutes apart.

IBERCIVIS board is formed by the Ministry of Innovation and Competitiveness of Spain, the regional Government of Aragon, CSIC, CIEMAT, University of Zaragoza and the Zaragoza City of Knowledge Foundation. IBERCIVIS was legally established in 2012 but the consortium has been working closely since 2007 both in Spain and Portugal (see www.ibercivis.pt). Since then, we have deployed more than 60 experiments from 40 different research groups reaching over 60.000 citizen scientists. Ours set of experiments and include volunteer computing (e.g. simulation of nuclear fusion devices yielding on average 8 million hours and 2.3 TFLOPS), volunteer sensing (e.g. odour nuisances reports: OdourCollect), participatory experiments (e.g. human behaviour in dilemma), or collective intelligence projects (e.g. collective music composition) among others. We support groups with hardware (e.g. hosting, load balance, security services), middleware (e.g. tech eulogies such as BOINC, PyBossa, EpiCollect) and software development (e.g. multi device developments or libraries such as gromacs or autodock). Despite ICT and virtual experiments are our focus, due to the digitally enabled borderless transformation of research, reaching new scales of number and range of contributors, we also work offline with expanded laboratories open to the public such as fablabs or wet labs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe deploy, support and promote the general public engagement in science with research and educational purposes. We play a central role in the Citizen Science Community at local, national and international levels. We are the national institution of Spain promoting citizen science and we run the portal Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain (www.ciencia-ciudadana.es) We are part of the steering committee of the European Citizen Science Association, linking it with responsible research and innovation, working on the adaptation of the RRI-Tools self reflection tool for the CitSci communities and #CitSciChatES among other actives. Since 2012 we coordinate the European project Socientize (www.socientize.eu) which delivered the White Paper on Citizen Science for Europe, referenced as a flagship document for the citizen science policy making. IBERCIVIS and Socientize have been referenced as best practices by several institutions and initiatives, highlighting the European Commission, the Australian Citizen Science Association, RRI-Tools, RRI-ICT, Ars Electronica or Cotec Foundation among others. IBERCIVIS has been marked as good practice in several scenarios, including open governance and grass-roots initiatives. We set up the interaction between science and society for scientific policy making in Socientize. In addition to create the inclusive scenarios for citizen-lead projects, we support social innovation by providing scientific resources and equipment for citizen involvement in scientific research.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"logo\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-07_101009094141_643_LOGO_DEF_1.png\",\"contactPoint\":\"Francisco Sanz\",\"contactPointEmail\":\"info@ibercivis.es\",\"latitude\":\"41.684275\",\"longitude\":\"-0.887436\",\"country\":\"ES\",\"creator\":1,\"orgType\":2}],\"latitude\":\"39.326234\",\"longitude\":\"-4.838065\",\"country\":\"ES\",\"author\":\"\",\"author_email\":\"\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-05-22_101005055252_201_IMAGEN%20Proyecto%20COVID-PHYM.jpg\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-05-22_101005055252_600_ESTRUCTURA-CORONAVIRUS_baja.jpg\",\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-05-22_101005055252_178_IMAGEN%20Proyecto%20COVID-PHYM.jpg\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"CSIC, FundaciÃ³n Ibercivis\",\"howToParticipate\":\"Download and install BOINC from https://boinc.berkeley.edu/.

By studying common garden species and monitoring the effects of actions for wildlife, Naturehood looks to fill this knowledge gap and encourage environmentally aware communities.

LandSense deploys advanced tools, services and resources to mobilise and engage citizens to collect in-situ observations (i.e. ground-based data and visual interpretations of EO imagery).

LandSense aims to uncover the collective potential of citizen science and Earth observation (EO) data to improve the way people see, map and understand the world. Citizen Observatories are community-driven mechanisms to complement existing systems for improved environmental monitoring. They are fostered through innovative and novel EO mobile applications, allowing citizens to not only play a key role in LULC monitoring, but also to be directly involved in the co-creation of such solutions. LandSense will deploy advanced tools, services and resources to mobilise and engage citizens to collect in-situ observations (i.e. ground-based data and visual interpretations of EO imagery). Integrating these citizen-driven in-situ data collections with established authoritative and open access data sources will help reduce costs, extend GEOSS and Copernicus capacities, and support comprehensive environmental monitoring systems. \\r\\n\\r\\nPolicy-relevant campaigns will be implemented in close collaboration with multiple stakeholders to ensure that citizen observations address user requirements and contribute to EU-wide environmental governance and decision-making. Campaigns for addressing local and regional Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) issues are planned for select areas in Austria, France, Germany, Spain, Slovenia and Serbia. Novel LandSense services will be deployed and tested in these areas to address critical LULC issues (i.e. urbanisation, agricultural land use and forest/habitat monitoring). For example, local residents in the cities of Vienna, Amsterdam and Heidelberg will help cooperatively detect and map changes in land cover and green space to address key issues of urban sprawl and land take. Such campaigns are facilitated through numerous pathways of citizen empowerment via the LandSense Engagement Platform, i.e. tools for discussion, online voting collaborative mapping, as well as events linked to public consultation and cooperative planning. In addition to creating tools for data collection, quality assurance, and interaction with the public, the project aims to drive innovation through collaboration with the private sector. LandSense will build an innovation marketplace to attract a vast community of users across numerous disciplines and sectors and boost Europeâ€™s role in the business of ground-based monitoring.\",\"keywords\":[{\"id\":52,\"keyword\":\"earth observation\"},{\"id\":56,\"keyword\":\"innovation\"},{\"id\":57,\"keyword\":\"in-situ monitoring\"}],\"status\":{\"id\":2,\"status\":\"Active\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":1,\"topic\":\"Agriculture & Veterinary science\"},{\"id\":5,\"topic\":\"Biodiversity\"},{\"id\":11,\"topic\":\"Ecology & Environment\"},{\"id\":23,\"topic\":\"Nature & outdoors\"},{\"id\":24,\"topic\":\"Natural resource management\"}],\"start_date\":\"2016-09-01\",\"end_date\":\"2020-08-31\",\"url\":\"https://landsense.eu/\",\"mainOrganisation\":null,\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"48.068444\",\"longitude\":\"16.352119\",\"country\":\"AT\",\"author\":\"moorthy@iiasa.ac.at\",\"author_email\":\"moorthy@iiasa.ac.at\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_070703035050_859_main_prev.9cef7e9b.jpg\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_070703035050_847_LandSense.3f816bf4.png\",\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_070703035050_596_main_prev.9cef7e9b.jpg\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"IIASA\",\"howToParticipate\":\"In a nutshell, the LandSense Engagement Platform is the marketplace where citizens can participate in the various Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) related campaigns and interested parties can reuse existing services and register new applications: https://landsense.eu/Project/LEP\\r\\nUse the power of existing LandSense service and tools to develop your own innovative Citizen Science campaigns that meet your needs and solve your research question: https://landsense.eu/Innovate\\r\\nParticipate in the LandSense Challenge, which targets individuals, web-entrepreneurs, start-ups and SMEs coming from all participating Horizon 2020 countries, to present innovative IT solutions addressing one of the three LandSense domains:\\r\\n- Urban Landscape Dynamics\\r\\n- Agricultural Land Use\\r\\n- Forest & Habitat Monitoring\\r\\nhttps://landsense.eu/Challenge\",\"doingAtHome\":false,\"equipment\":\"Smartphone, computer and other tech equipment\",\"fundingBody\":{\"id\":6,\"body\":\"European Commission\"},\"fundingProgram\":\"H2020-EU.3.5.5.\",\"originDatabase\":null,\"originURL\":\"\",\"originUID\":\"\",\"featured\":false,\"customField\":[],\"dateCreated\":\"2020-03-25T07:24:50.438627Z\",\"origin\":\"\"},{\"id\":157,\"name\":\"Herpterkep\",\"aim\":\"Mapping herptetofauna of Hungary\",\"description\":\"Website was started in 2011 with the aim to collect observations on the herpetofauna of Hungary.\",\"keywords\":[],\"status\":{\"id\":2,\"status\":\"Active\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":2,\"topic\":\"Animals\"},{\"id\":21,\"topic\":\"Long-term species monitoring\"}],\"start_date\":\"2011-03-01\",\"end_date\":null,\"url\":\"https://herpterkep.mme.hu/?lang=en\",\"mainOrganisation\":null,\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"47.181759\",\"longitude\":\"19.506094\",\"country\":\"HU\",\"author\":\"Balint Halpern\",\"author_email\":\"herpterkep@gmail.com\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-06-30_080806061919_804_Terkepezes-logo_EN.jpg\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-06-30_080806061919_813_Terkepezes-logo.jpg\",\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-06-30_080806061919_754_Terkepezes-banner.jpg\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"MME BirdLife Hungary\",\"howToParticipate\":\"Anyone can register with e-mail address on the website or by downloading our free Android app. After login, anyone can upload observation.\",\"doingAtHome\":true,\"equipment\":\"Smartphone or computer, camera for making picture (observation data with picture as proof is preferred)\",\"fundingBody\":null,\"fundingProgram\":\"\",\"originDatabase\":null,\"originURL\":\"\",\"originUID\":\"\",\"featured\":false,\"customField\":[],\"dateCreated\":\"2020-06-30T08:09:19.633441Z\",\"origin\":\"\"},{\"id\":30,\"name\":\"GROW Observatory\",\"aim\":\"The GROW Observatory is a  Citizensâ€™ Observatory that has empowered people and whole communities to take action on soils and climate across Europe.

By using the later, we are going to derive products to determine the areas that are better fit for useful in-situ observations (because they present a clear phenological signal and are in an area known for presenting species easy to observe). In parallel we will generate a new observation protocol of in-situ phenology and we will request RitmeNatura.cat existing participants and new volunteers to use it in the next spring and fall observation campaign. They will be encouraged to provide observations as well as user feedback based on their experience (using a third element already developed by the group: the EU NextGEOSS NiMMbus system). The project will finalize when the results of the user feedback will be applied to improve both, the remote sensing products and the observation protocol for next year.

The iSPEX team, led by Frans Snik of Leiden University, analyzed all measurements from three days in 2013 and combined them into unique maps of dust particles above the Netherlands. The results match and sometimes even exceed those of ground-based measurement networks and satellite instruments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iSPEX maps achieve a spatial resolution as small as 2 kilometers whereas satellite data are much courser. They also fill in blind spots of established ground-based atmospheric measurement networks. The scientific article that presents these first results of the iSPEX project is being published today in Geophysical Research Letters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iSPEX team developed a new atmospheric measurement method in the form of a low-cost add-on for smartphone cameras [1]. The iSPEX app instructs participants to scan the blue sky while the phoneâ€™s built-in camera takes pictures through the add-on. The photos record both the spectrum and the linear polarization [2,3] of the sunlight that is scattered by suspended dust particles, and thus contain information about the properties of these particles. While such properties are difficult to measure, much better knowledge on atmospheric particles is needed to understand their effects on health, climate and air traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of participants performed iSPEX measurements throughout the Netherlands on three cloud-free days in 2013. This large-scale citizen science experiment allowed the iSPEX team to verify the reliability of this new measurement method.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a rigorous quality assessment of each submitted data point, measurements recorded in specific areas within a limited amount of time are averaged to obtain sufficient accuracy. Subsequently the data are converted to Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), which is a standardized quantity related to the total amount of atmospheric particles. The iSPEX AOT data match comparable data from satellites and the AERONET ground station at Cabauw, the Netherlands. In areas with sufficiently high measurement densities, the iSPEX maps can even discern smaller details than satellite data.\\\"\\r\\n\",\"keywords\":[],\"status\":{\"id\":5,\"status\":\"Completed\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":11,\"topic\":\"Ecology & Environment\"}],\"start_date\":null,\"end_date\":null,\"url\":\"http://ispex.nl/en/\",\"mainOrganisation\":null,\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"52.168354\",\"longitude\":\"4.457569\",\"country\":\"NL\",\"author\":\"Frans Snik\",\"author_email\":\"info@ispex.nl\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-07_030304042727_59_ispex-team1.jpg\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-07_030304042727_500_Gespot_46_iSPEXlogo.png\",\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-07_030304042727_374_ispex-team1.jpg\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"Leiden University\",\"howToParticipate\":\"The campaign for measuring air quality has closed.

In this new project, we expand the framework to three new cities in northern Spain: Oviedo, Pamplona and Pontevedra. The following institutions are involved: the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid (CSIC), the Spanish Biodiversity Information Node (GBIF.ES), the University of Vigo, the University of Oviedo, the University of Navarra, the Terrabiota association of Pamplona, the University of Barcelona and the Institute of Marine Sciences (CSIC).\\r\\nAir pollution is one of the major problems facing big and medium city inhabitants. The burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, heating systems and industry generates numerous contaminating compounds - especially nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter - which suppose a serious problem for human health. It has been demonstrated that, in high concentrations, these compounds generate multiple respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and they are responsible for around 800,000 deaths per year in Europe.\\r\\nThe grounds of this project are based on the role of lichen species as bioindicators of different levels of air pollution. Lichens are complex symbiotic organisms formed by the union of a fungus and at least one photosynthetic partner, green algae and/or cyanobacteria. Lichens have been used for decades as bioindicators of anthropic disturbances, especially air pollution. Sensibility to disturbances vary among species, though, and it is possible to identify species with a range of preferences regarding levels of certain pollutants. Overall, it is generally accepted that the greater the diversity of lichens, the better the air quality. \\r\\nLiquencityÂ·2 use nine indicator species growing on trees in each city, which reflect three different levels of tolerance to air pollution. To map species distribution, and therefore air quality history distribution, the project involves the educative communities (teacher training centers, teachers, students mainly from high schools) and other agents in local communities (associations, independent citizens). Using the information provided in our web site (www.liquencity2.org) and the new app for mobile devices, participants can record the observations and take pictures of them, in order to be corroborated by a team of lichen experts.

Such an organization shows nowadays two main limitations: (1) the slow process of mediatization of academic knowledge, and (2) perceived low impact of such knowledge for society, especially for disciplines in the fields of the social sciences and the humanities (SSH). The importance of the current phenomenon of massive disinformation in democratic societies can be seen as a direct consequence of this problem of the organization of scientific communication.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo explore a new model for science communication, the PLACES project proposes to bring together practitioners from the two professional worlds of journalism and SSH research, from the very beginning of knowledge production, in order to make them both co-actors of the overall process. The aim is to break down the silos of research practices, by creating the conditions for a dialogue on the modalities of science production (as opposed to vertical communication characterizing the dissemination mode). From this point of view, the project aims to put into practice collaborations following the model of \\\"Extreme Citizen Science\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTo do so, the PLACES project supports three experimental collaborative researches, each bringing together a SSH researcher and a journalist, with the aim of highlighting the difficulties and obstacles encountered in this type of inter-professional collaboration. In order to synthesize and problematize what has been observed, the three experimental researches are then observed by professional researchers in order to write a research report on the subject and to make proposals for the creation of a specific platform supporting this type of collaboration.\",\"description\":\"The first goal of the PLACES project is to bring social science and humanities (SSH) researchers and journalists to work hand in hand on the same research, i.e. to define a subject of study, to explore a field and produce a common analysis, or even to shape together the final product that will be disseminated. Three experimental investigations have been engaged. The first explored the life of young people (under 50) with Alzheimer's disease, producing a final podcast series broadcasted by Binge Audio. The second explored the issue of migration effects during a municipal election in a border area between France and Italy, leading to a series of three press articles on CafÃ©babel.com. The third investigation, explores the issue of \\\"false periods\\\" induced in women by contraceptive pills, and will be published by 20 Minutes France. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second goal of the PLACES project is to observe these collaborations between SSH researchers and journalists at work during their implementation, in order to identify the obstacles, the needs for support, and the successes of such collaborations, and the way they can provide a model for renewing the communication of research. These observations are carried out by a team of two researchers, one in language sciences and the other in anthropology. Their analyses will be published in the form of a research report.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third goal is to draft specifications for the creation of a platform supporting the close collaboration of SSH researchers and journalists involved in a joint research project. The challenge here is to provide the participants first of all with a privileged communication channel as well as a database of different resources needed, but also a toolbox for applications facilitating data sharing and, more largely, collaborative work.\\r\\n\",\"keywords\":[{\"id\":114,\"keyword\":\"Digital Platform\"},{\"id\":158,\"keyword\":\"Journalism\"},{\"id\":159,\"keyword\":\"Cooperative Survey\"}],\"status\":{\"id\":2,\"status\":\"Active\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":19,\"topic\":\"Information & Computing sciences\"},{\"id\":27,\"topic\":\"Social sciences\"}],\"start_date\":\"2019-01-01\",\"end_date\":\"2020-12-31\",\"url\":\"https://places.hypotheses.org/\",\"mainOrganisation\":null,\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"48.856697\",\"longitude\":\"2.351462\",\"country\":\"FR\",\"author\":\"Alessia Smaniotto\",\"author_email\":\"alessia.smaniotto@openedition.org\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-06-13_070706060303_39_The%20New%20York%20Times%20on%20the%20New%20Art%20of%20Flickr_1380_1.jpg\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":null,\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-05-16_010105052121_521_The%20New%20York%20Times%20on%20the%20New%20Art%20of%20Flickr_1380_1.jpg\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"EHESS\",\"howToParticipate\":\"\",\"doingAtHome\":false,\"equipment\":\"\",\"fundingBody\":{\"id\":27,\"body\":\"MinistÃ¨re de la Culture et de la communication - RÃ©publique FranÃ§aise\"},\"fundingProgram\":\"Fonds de soutien Ã  l'Ã©mergence et Ã  l'innovation dans la presse\",\"originDatabase\":null,\"originURL\":\"\",\"originUID\":\"\",\"featured\":false,\"customField\":[],\"dateCreated\":\"2020-06-19T09:24:07.915550Z\",\"origin\":\"\"},{\"id\":154,\"name\":\"Community Drive\",\"aim\":\"The overall aim of Community DRive is to educate young people to solve authentic complex problems and transform cities through open data driven methods by breaking boundaries between research institutions, local communities and local governments through the involvement of new types of actors, forms of knowledge and institutions. \",\"description\":\"Elementary school and educational institutions are challenged by not adequately educating children and young people for self-knowledge and solving complex societal challenges. At the same time involving citizens and communities outside traditional research institutions as participants in research systems and professional development has been defined as a megatrend that will influence future research policy. The project Community Drive is in scope with the topic by addressing research-based education development. The project involves phases with initial theoretical and research mapping of the field Citizen Science and Community driven science as well as phases with concrete development and interventions on schools in vulnerable districts in Copenhagen. The project address three overall challenges: \\r\\n\\r\\nChallenge 1 addresses the need to develop student skills in solving complex problems. The need to identify key competencies of the future has been the subject of education policy debate for several years. Citizen awareness and innovation and learning skills are highlighted as key conditions of collaboration between students and actors across institutions and disciplines. In Community Drive, a range of tools will be developed based on cases involving 21st century skills and design thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nChallenge 2 addresses the development of a more open and engaged research community. Open research is, first and foremost, a research agenda that can have a greater impact on society. Although it was primarily related to scientific publishing (open access), it also encourages knowledge sharing and involvement among users. Involvement of children and young people in teaching shows great educational potential and a strong motivation for students to participate in authentic research and development processes in collaboration with professional actors. Community Drive investigates how collaboration can be based on citizensâ€™ expertise and professionalsâ€™ skills. \\r\\n\\r\\nChallenge 3 deals with the cityâ€™s big open data and citizen involvement in urban development. The smart city and smart society are well-known concepts related to information and communication technology. The collection of information about the cityâ€™s â€œstatusâ€� can,in collaboration with citizens, be used to optimise resources and offer citizens new and better services. Coommunity Drive focus on the many types of data obtained in a city and the way to enable citizens to collect relevant data about the city. In particular, it will examine how existing data can be represented and applied by both students and other actors. This will contribute to the development of not only smart cities, but also smart citizens. \",\"keywords\":[],\"status\":{\"id\":2,\"status\":\"Active\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":12,\"topic\":\"Education\"}],\"start_date\":\"2018-05-01\",\"end_date\":\"2021-12-30\",\"url\":\"https://www.communitydrive.aau.dk/\",\"mainOrganisation\":null,\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"55.686724\",\"longitude\":\"12.570072\",\"country\":\"DK\",\"author\":\"Rikke Magnussen\",\"author_email\":\"rikkem@hum.aau.dk\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-06-19_010106065959_952_header%20sportscity.jpg\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-06-19_010106065959_112_logo%20community%20drive%20AAU.jpg\",\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-06-19_010106065959_83_map%20community%20drive.jpg\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"Aalborg University Copenhagen \",\"howToParticipate\":\"If you are interested in the project you are welcome to contact Rikke Magnussen on rikkem@hum.aau.dk\",\"doingAtHome\":false,\"equipment\":\"\",\"fundingBody\":null,\"fundingProgram\":\"\",\"originDatabase\":null,\"originURL\":\"\",\"originUID\":\"\",\"featured\":false,\"customField\":[],\"dateCreated\":\"2020-06-19T13:30:59.447003Z\",\"origin\":\"\"},{\"id\":66,\"name\":\"CoAstro - @n Astronomy Condo\",\"aim\":\"In astronomy the main goal of the research is not, very often, its dissemination to the public. However, its social relevance should be one a starting point. For the public, neither the understanding of the results, nor the processes that led to them, are trivial tasks. This is even more relevant when there is a large increase in scientific production. One way to address this challenge, used by research institutes, is to produce press releases, hoping that social media will echo them. Although this formula has obvious advantages, its randomness and the short-term effect, for example, leads to several limitations and tends to have limited duration and reduced impact on the public lacking awareness of astronomy. Thus, there is an urgent need to create mechanisms / strategies that quickly disseminate results of scientific innovation without discouraging, in the process, the promotion of positive attitudes towards science and the nature of science itself. However, the question is how to do this with the limited human resources and funding normally associated with outreach. To respond to these challenges CoAstro emerged: a citizen science project that aimed the idealization, implementation and evaluation of a scientific dissemination mechanism that would allow the flow of results and scientific processes between researchers and the public, through the involvement of dissemination structures (already present in research institutes) and non-scientific participants (teachers).\",\"description\":\"The high scientific production in astronomy impel us to find new ways to carry out scientific dissemination of content, but also, of processes. Thus, we can promote positive attitudes towards science and the public can more easily deal with bad science, scientific fraud and fake news. In this context CoAstro: @n Astronomy Condo emerged â€“ a citizen science project that directly connected four astronomers, nine elementary school teachers, four science disseminators and one mediator. CoAstroÂ´s, whose first edition lasted an academic year, scientific content and processes were appropriated and integrated by teachers in school initiatives, reaching approximately one thousand people.\\r\\nTeachers' involvement in astronomy research took place in two sub-projects: â€œStarsâ€� and â€œPlanetsâ€�. In the first, teachers analyzed standard stellar spectra that allow the qualitative and quantitative composition determination of 57000 stars. In addition, they determined star luminosity using Data Release 2 from the European Space Agency â€“ ESA â€“ GAIA Mission. In the planets project the team started with the production of a planetary transit video, through the Python program. Then, teachers analyzed curves to signal the presence of potential exoplanets. In the process, the mediator was integrated: he adapted the language and created â€œguidelines for research tasksâ€�. He also ensured the maintenance of the collaborative work, articulating the challenges of research, dissemination and teaching.\\r\\nThe scientific analysis of CoAstro's results was achieved by implementing a qualitative research. The data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and observations. Results showed high improvements in teachersâ€™ substantive and processual knowledge; positive change in epistemological attitudes and beliefs towards astronomy; as well as, the increasing of the quality of teachersâ€™ scientific dissemination practices.\\r\\nData from astronomers and disseminators, showed one main difference: science disseminators (unlike astronomers), have not changed their perception about teachersÂ´ professional class, due to their participation in CoAstro. Indeed, both groups agree that the project: i) was useful (and facilitated) astronomy dissemination work; ii) it was an opportunity for teachers to increase their procedural knowledge about astronomy; iii) was, at the outset, risky, because of its idea of involving teachers in real astronomy research; iv) reinforced their own perception about the importance and purposes of dissemination practices, promoting new communication skills and new ways of structuring astronomy dissemination activities.\\r\\nAlthough with some implementation difficulties (time, adequacy of tasks ...) CoAstro allowed us to understand how a citizen science project can contribute, with lasting and wide-public-ranging effects, to open the school to the surrounding community and vice-versa and how the public can open up to astronomy research and the latter to the public.\",\"keywords\":[{\"id\":131,\"keyword\":\"Astronomy\"}],\"status\":{\"id\":2,\"status\":\"Active\"},\"topic\":[{\"id\":4,\"topic\":\"Astronomy & Space\"},{\"id\":12,\"topic\":\"Education\"}],\"start_date\":\"2018-10-15\",\"end_date\":null,\"url\":\"https://condominio.astro.up.pt/\",\"mainOrganisation\":null,\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"41.150934\",\"longitude\":\"-8.638451\",\"country\":\"PT\",\"author\":\"IlÃ­dio AndrÃ© Costa\",\"author_email\":\"coastro@astro.up.pt\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-07_070704041818_108_Planetario_CoAstro_HD.png\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-07_070704041919_225_COASTRO_FUNDOBRANCO.png\",\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":null,\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"CAUP / IA / FCUP / PP-CCV\",\"howToParticipate\":\"Apply here: https://condominio.astro.up.pt/?page_id=264\",\"doingAtHome\":true,\"equipment\":\"Personal computer without the need for any special specifications or software.\",\"fundingBody\":null,\"fundingProgram\":\"\",\"originDatabase\":null,\"originURL\":\"\",\"originUID\":\"\",\"featured\":false,\"customField\":[],\"dateCreated\":\"2020-07-24T08:48:53.285386Z\",\"origin\":\"\"},{\"id\":109,\"name\":\"CrowdWater\",\"aim\":\"CrowdWater stands for an independent and reliable data collection by citizens for modelling of floods and droughts and as a supplement to existing measurements.

IBERCIVIS was legally established in 2012 but the consortium has been working closely since 2007 both in Spain and Portugal (see www.ibercivis.pt). Since then, we have deployed more than 60 experiments from 40 different research groups reaching over 60.000 citizen scientists. Ours set of experiments and include volunteer computing (e.g. simulation of nuclear fusion devices yielding on average 8 million hours and 2.3 TFLOPS), volunteer sensing (e.g. odour nuisances reports: OdourCollect), participatory experiments (e.g. human behaviour in dilemma), or collective intelligence projects (e.g. collective music composition) among others. We support groups with hardware (e.g. hosting, load balance, security services), middleware (e.g. tech eulogies such as BOINC, PyBossa, EpiCollect) and software development (e.g. multi device developments or libraries such as gromacs or autodock). Despite ICT and virtual experiments are our focus, due to the digitally enabled borderless transformation of research, reaching new scales of number and range of contributors, we also work offline with expanded laboratories open to the public such as fablabs or wet labs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe deploy, support and promote the general public engagement in science with research and educational purposes.

Since 2012 we coordinate the European project Socientize (www.socientize.eu) which delivered the White Paper on Citizen Science for Europe, referenced as a flagship document for the citizen science policy making. IBERCIVIS and Socientize have been referenced as best practices by several institutions and initiatives, highlighting the European Commission, the Australian Citizen Science Association, RRI-Tools, RRI-ICT, Ars Electronica or Cotec Foundation among others. IBERCIVIS has been marked as good practice in several scenarios, including open governance and grass-roots initiatives. We set up the interaction between science and society for scientific policy making in Socientize. In addition to create the inclusive scenarios for citizen-lead projects, we support social innovation by providing scientific resources and equipment for citizen involvement in scientific research.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"logo\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-07_101009094141_643_LOGO_DEF_1.png\",\"contactPoint\":\"Francisco Sanz\",\"contactPointEmail\":\"info@ibercivis.es\",\"latitude\":\"41.684275\",\"longitude\":\"-0.887436\",\"country\":\"ES\",\"creator\":1,\"orgType\":2},\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"41.659421\",\"longitude\":\"-0.898213\",\"country\":\"ES\",\"author\":\"Rosa Arias\",\"author_email\":\"rosa.arias@scienceforchange.eu\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_060603031414_789_cropped-workshop-Nora-Salas-Seoane.png\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":null,\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_060603031414_337_cropped-workshop-Nora-Salas-Seoane.png\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"Ibercivis Foundation\",\"howToParticipate\":\"  ...\",\"doingAtHome\":true,\"equipment\":\"<div class=\\\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\\\"><div class=\\\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\\\">A mobile and your nose</div></div>\",\"fundingBody\":{\"id\":6,\"body\":\"European Commission\"},\"fundingProgram\":\"\",\"originDatabase\":null,\"originURL\":\"\",\"originUID\":\"\",\"featured\":false,\"customField\":[],\"dateCreated\":\"2020-09-08T01:32:12.844112Z\",\"origin\":\"\"},{\"id\":18,\"name\":\"WeObserve\",\"aim\":\"<p>WeObserve â€“ An Ecosystem of Citizen Observatories for Environmental Monitoring â€“improves the coordination between Citizen Observatories and regional, European and international activities to tackle and research three key challenges that Citizen Observatories face: awareness, acceptability and sustainability.

IBERCIVIS board is formed by the Ministry of Innovation and Competitiveness of Spain, the regional Government of Aragon, CSIC, CIEMAT, University of Zaragoza and the Zaragoza City of Knowledge Foundation. IBERCIVIS was legally established in 2012 but the consortium has been working closely since 2007 both in Spain and Portugal (see www.ibercivis.pt). Since then, we have deployed more than 60 experiments from 40 different research groups reaching over 60.000 citizen scientists. Ours set of experiments and include volunteer computing (e.g. simulation of nuclear fusion devices yielding on average 8 million hours and 2.3 TFLOPS), volunteer sensing (e.g. odour nuisances reports: OdourCollect), participatory experiments (e.g. human behaviour in dilemma), or collective intelligence projects (e.g. collective music composition) among others. We support groups with hardware (e.g. hosting, load balance, security services), middleware (e.g. tech eulogies such as BOINC, PyBossa, EpiCollect) and software development (e.g. multi device developments or libraries such as gromacs or autodock). Despite ICT and virtual experiments are our focus, due to the digitally enabled borderless transformation of research, reaching new scales of number and range of contributors, we also work offline with expanded laboratories open to the public such as fablabs or wet labs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe deploy, support and promote the general public engagement in science with research and educational purposes. We play a central role in the Citizen Science Community at local, national and international levels. We are the national institution of Spain promoting citizen science and we run the portal Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain (www.ciencia-ciudadana.es) We are part of the steering committee of the European Citizen Science Association, linking it with responsible research and innovation, working on the adaptation of the RRI-Tools self reflection tool for the CitSci communities and #CitSciChatES among other actives. Since 2012 we coordinate the European project Socientize (www.socientize.eu) which delivered the White Paper on Citizen Science for Europe, referenced as a flagship document for the citizen science policy making. IBERCIVIS and Socientize have been referenced as best practices by several institutions and initiatives, highlighting the European Commission, the Australian Citizen Science Association, RRI-Tools, RRI-ICT, Ars Electronica or Cotec Foundation among others. IBERCIVIS has been marked as good practice in several scenarios, including open governance and grass-roots initiatives. We set up the interaction between science and society for scientific policy making in Socientize. In addition to create the inclusive scenarios for citizen-lead projects, we support social innovation by providing scientific resources and equipment for citizen involvement in scientific research.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"logo\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-07_101009094141_643_LOGO_DEF_1.png\",\"contactPoint\":\"Francisco Sanz\",\"contactPointEmail\":\"info@ibercivis.es\",\"latitude\":\"41.684275\",\"longitude\":\"-0.887436\",\"country\":\"ES\",\"creator\":1,\"orgType\":2},\"organisation\":[],\"latitude\":\"41.662144\",\"longitude\":\"-0.879606\",\"country\":\"ES\",\"author\":\"Enrique Torres Navarro\",\"author_email\":\"info@ibercivis.es\",\"image1\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_050503034545_648_Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202020-03-24%2006-34-04.png\",\"imageCredit1\":\"\",\"image2\":null,\"imageCredit2\":\"\",\"image3\":\"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_050503034545_261_Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202020-03-24%2006-34-04.png\",\"imageCredit3\":\"\",\"host\":\"Unizar, Ibercivis\",\"howToParticipate\":\"..\",\"doingAtHome\":true,\"equipment\":\"\",\"fundingBody\":{\"id\":5,\"body\":\"Fecyt-Ministerio de Ciencia y TecnologÃ­a\"},\"fundingProgram\":\"\",\"originDatabase\":null,\"originURL\":\"\",\"originUID\":\"\",\"featured\":false,\"customField\":[],\"dateCreated\":\"2020-09-08T01:30:31.667409Z\",\"origin\":\"\"},{\"id\":125,\"name\":\"Plastic Spotter\",\"aim\":\"Investigate how much plastic can be found in the canals and other waters of the city Leiden in the Netherlands.

The case was brought by a civic group based in part on citizen sensed-evidence which involved volunteer observations performed over years. This practice entailing grassroots-driven environmental monitoring could be qualified as â€˜Citizen Scienceâ€™ and, more specifically, â€˜Citizen Sensingâ€™. The contamination could not be proved through existing data held by competent authorities since the company never filed any record of pollution with the competent authority. Rather, the monitoring and data collection was almost entirely conducted by local residents.\\r\\nCases such as the Formosa litigation are expected to increase drastically. They pose urgent research questions. Above all, the case motivates an investigation of the potential of introducing Citizen Sensing as a source of evidence in litigation over environmental wrongdoings. Furthermore, Citizen Sensing may also play a role in avoiding the court stage, as a tool to mediate the environmental conflict and to steer the responsible company to adopt an environmentally-compliant behaviour.\\r\\nRelated research is still in its infancy.

Registered users can upload observations using a short form. This form includes issues related to observations, their relationship to climate change, and the acceptability of adaptation measures. The observations, once uploaded by the user, are validated by the project team. Uploaded observations can be consulted on the project map. Educational resources can also be consulted in the App. The project is complemented with participatory workshops and educational activities. The information collected is used in the research works carried out by the group like as a reconstruction of past events.

The reason behind is the general use of manta trawls towed by boats or research vessels to obtain samples, which hinders nearshore sampling. We have designed a manta trawl to collect samples in the near-shore from any type of recreational sports floating gear like kayaks, sailboats, rowing boats, windsurf boards and others.

This plant blindness can be explained by a lack of interest in and focus on plant science in education in favour of animals. However, most life on earth, including humans, depend mainly on plants for food and shelter. Consequently, it is important for society to acknowledge the importance of plants and combat plant blindness. City sidewalk plant communities survive despite the extreme stress factors of urban environments, for instance, drought, access to little soil, high levels of manual disturbance and herbicides. Therefore, these plants are highly adaptable and could show how plants change and survive in extreme environments. Previous studies in urban ecology have shown that plant species richness, and anthropogenic factors can best explain biodiversity. These factors and their role in plant species composition, richness and diversity needs further study to infer which species or species communities are highly successful in these challenging urban environments. To understand the ecology of urban plant communities could help us design sustainable and biodiverse green cities in the future.',\n",

The majority of citizens however, both as individuals and as groups quite often feel disengaged from influencing environmental policies, whilst also remain unaware of publicly available information and initiatives. \\r\\nSCENT Citizen Observatory project has created a toolbox (https://scent-project.eu/scent-toolbox) of smart collaborative technologies and applications that aims to engage citizens with environmental monitoring, enabling them to become the ‘eyes’ of the policy makers and local authorities.

CoAct&rsquo;s ambitious Research and Innovation activities will respond to issues related to Mental Health Care, Youth Employment, Environmental Justice and Gender Equality in Barcelona, Vienna, Berlin, Buenos Aires and in European Eastern countries. CoAct will define and develop a general framework for Citizen Social Science as a participatory research co-designed and directly driven by citizen groups sharing a social concern. The methodological framework will be first incubated in a consortium with Research Organizations, NGOs and global networks of Open Science and Open Data activism. Expertises from Computational Social Science, Participatory Action Research, Citizen Science evaluation or Citizen-generated Data will be incorporated to conceive a transdisciplinary Citizen Social Science that place vulnerable citizens at the center of Research and Innovation cycles, as co-designers and co-researchers. Secondly, three mission-oriented Actions and at least three Research Pilots will be led by vulnerable citizen groups with the support of Knowledge Coalitions formed by public bodies, CSOs and social innovators. The common effort will harness novel, simultaneously global and local, socially robust knowledge and scientifically reasoned measures to promote social change. An Open Citizen Science toolkit, Open Source digital platforms, and Capacity Building activities to improve data and science literacy, including a PhD Summer School, will be delivered.

Such an organization shows nowadays two main limitations: (1) the slow process of mediatization of academic knowledge, and (2) perceived low impact of such knowledge for society, especially for disciplines in the fields of the social sciences and the humanities (SSH). The importance of the current phenomenon of massive disinformation in democratic societies can be seen as a direct consequence of this problem of the organization of scientific communication.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo explore a new model for science communication, the PLACES project proposes to bring together practitioners from the two professional worlds of journalism and SSH research, from the very beginning of knowledge production, in order to make them both co-actors of the overall process. The aim is to break down the silos of research practices, by creating the conditions for a dialogue on the modalities of science production (as opposed to vertical communication characterizing the dissemination mode). From this point of view, the project aims to put into practice collaborations following the model of \"Extreme Citizen Science\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTo do so, the PLACES project supports three experimental collaborative researches, each bringing together a SSH researcher and a journalist, with the aim of highlighting the difficulties and obstacles encountered in this type of inter-professional collaboration. In order to synthesize and problematize what has been observed, the three experimental researches are then observed by professional researchers in order to write a research report on the subject and to make proposals for the creation of a specific platform supporting this type of collaboration.',\n",

However, its social relevance should be one a starting point. For the public, neither the understanding of the results, nor the processes that led to them, are trivial tasks. This is even more relevant when there is a large increase in scientific production. One way to address this challenge, used by research institutes, is to produce press releases, hoping that social media will echo them. Although this formula has obvious advantages, its randomness and the short-term effect, for example, leads to several limitations and tends to have limited duration and reduced impact on the public lacking awareness of astronomy. Thus, there is an urgent need to create mechanisms / strategies that quickly disseminate results of scientific innovation without discouraging, in the process, the promotion of positive attitudes towards science and the nature of science itself. However, the question is how to do this with the limited human resources and funding normally associated with outreach. To respond to these challenges CoAstro emerged: a citizen science project that aimed the idealization, implementation and evaluation of a scientific dissemination mechanism that would allow the flow of results and scientific processes between researchers and the public, through the involvement of dissemination structures (already present in research institutes) and non-scientific participants (teachers).',\n",

ESSRG interprets and synthesises the gathered data in order to gain a better understanding of self-provisioning practices. While testing the tool, Járókelőkutató is introduced to the wider circle of NGOs and citizen science initiatives in Hungary as an available tool for adapting further bottom-up citizen science projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pilot project was developed via several discussions taking place among ESSRG researchers and Járókelő developers. Desk research was conducted on food-related citizen science tools before it gained its final shape. Due to COVID-19, the theme of food sovereignty received more attention as a concept. The present tool not only serves as a pilot of the freshly developed tool but it also reflects on what has stood out as a highly appreciated food production practice during the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nJárókelőkutató enables citizens to share their observations in relation to their homegrown plants, vegetables, fruits and seeds. Video recording allows one to share their gardening methods and practices. In its current form, Járókelőkutató citizen science tool is available in forms of an online platform via PC.\\r\\n',\n",
